Protein adsorption to the surface of a nanoparticle can fundamentally alter the
character, behavior, and fate of a nanoparticle in vivo. Current methods to
capture the protein corona rely on physical separation techniques and are unable 
to resolve key, individual protein-nanoparticle interactions. As a result, the
precise link between the "synthetic" and the "biological" identity of a
nanoparticle remains unclear. Herein, we report an unbiased photoaffinity-based
approach to capture, characterize, and quantify the protein corona of liposomes
in their native state. Compared to conventional methods, our photoaffinity
approach reveals markedly different interacting proteins as well as reduced total
protein binding to liposome surfaces. Identified proteins do not follow protein
abundancy patterns of human serum, as has been generally reported, but are
instead dominated by soluble apolipoproteins-endogenous serum proteins that have 
evolved to recognize the lipidic surface of circulating lipoproteins. We believe 
our findings are the most accurate characterization of a liposome's biological
identity but, more fundamentally, reveal liposome-protein binding is, in many
cases, significantly less complex than previously thought.

Two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets (NSs) have a large surface area, high surface
free energy, and ultrathin structure, which enable them to more easily penetrate 
biological membranes and promote adsorption of drugs and proteins. NSs are
capable of adsorbing a large amount of blood proteins to form NSs-protein corona 
complexes; however, their inflammatory effects are still unknown. Therefore, we
investigated the pro-inflammatory effect of 2D model nanosheet structures,
molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), and the MoS2 NSs-protein complexes with four
abundant proteins in human blood, i.e., human serum albumin (HSA), transferrin
(Tf), fibrinogen (Fg), and immunoglobulin G (IgG). The interactions between the
NSs and the proteins were analyzed by quantifying protein adsorption, determining
binding affinity, and correlating structural changes in the protein corona with
the uptake of NSs by macrophages and the subsequent inflammatory response.
Although all of the NSs-protein complexes induced inflammation, IgG-coated and
Fg-coated NSs triggered much stronger inflammatory effects by producing and
releasing more cytokines. Among the four proteins, IgG possessed the highest
proportion of β-sheets and led to fewer secondary structure changes on the MoS2
nanosheets. This can facilitate uptake and produce a stronger pro-inflammatory
response in macrophages due to the recognition of an NSs-IgG complex by Fc gamma 
receptors and the subsequent activation of the NF-κB pathways. Our results
demonstrate that the blood protein components contribute to the inflammatory
effects of nanosheets and provide important insights for the nanosafety
evaluation and the rational design of nanomedicines in the future.

Polymeric nanoparticles play important roles in the delivery of a multitude of
therapeutic and imaging contrast agents. Although these nanomaterials have shown 
tremendous potential in disease diagnosis and therapy, there have been many
reports on the failure of these nanoparticles in realizing their intended
objectives due to an individual or a combination of factors, which have
collectively challenged the merit of nanomedicine for disease theranostics.
Herein, we investigate the interactions of polymeric nanoparticles with
biological entities from molecular to organism levels. Specifically, the protein 
corona formation, in vitro endothelial uptake, and in vivo circulation time of
these nanoparticles are systematically probed. We identify the crucial role of
nanocarrier lipophilicity, zeta-potential, and size in controlling the
interactions between nanoparticles and biological systems and propose a two-step 
framework in formulating a single nanoparticle system to regulate multiple
biological effects. This study provides insight into the rational design and
optimization of the performance of polymeric nanoparticles to advance their
theranostic and nanomedicine applications.

Bioorthogonal activation of prodrugs provides a strategy for on-demand on-site
production of therapeutics. Intracellular activation provides a strategy to
localize therapeutics, potentially minimizing off-target effects. To this end,
nanoparticles embedded with transition metal catalysts (nanozymes) were
engineered to generate either "hard" irreversible or "soft" reversible coronas in
serum. The hard corona induced nanozyme aggregation, effectively inhibiting
nanozyme activity, whereas only modest loss of activity was observed with the
nonaggregating soft corona nanozymes. In both cases complete activity was
restored by treatment with proteases. Intracellular activity mirrored this
reactivation: endogenous proteases in the endosome provided intracellular
activation of both nanozymes. The role of intracellular proteases in nanozyme
reactivation was verified through treatment of the cells with protease
inhibitors, which prevented reactivation. This study demonstrates the use of
intracellular proteolysis as a strategy for localization of therapeutic
generation to within cells.

Nano-sized objects such as liposomes are modified by adsorption of biomolecules
in biological fluids. The resulting corona critically changes nanoparticle
behavior at cellular level. A better control of corona composition could allow to
modulate uptake by cells. Within this context, in this work, liposomes of
different charge were prepared by mixing negatively charged and zwitterionic
lipids to different ratios. The series obtained was used as a model system with
tailored surface properties to modulate corona composition and determine the
effects on liposome interactions with cells. Uptake efficiency and uptake
kinetics of the different liposomes were determined by flow cytometry and
fluorescence imaging. Particular care was taken in optimizing the methods to
isolate the corona forming in human serum to prevent liposome agglomeration and
to exclude residual free proteins, which could confuse the results. Thanks to the
optimized methods, mass spectrometry of replicate corona isolations showed
excellent reproducibility and this allowed semi-quantitative analysis to
determine for each formulation the most abundant proteins in the corona. The
results showed that by changing the fraction of zwitterionic and charged lipids
in the bilayer, the amount and identity of the most abundant proteins adsorbed
from serum differed. Interestingly, the formulations also showed very different
uptake kinetics. Similar approaches can be used to tune lipid composition in a
systematic way in order to obtain formulations with the desired corona and cell
uptake behavior. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Liposomes and other nano-sized
objects when introduced in biological fluids are known to adsorb biomolecules
forming the so-called nanoparticle corona. This layer strongly affects the
subsequent interactions of liposomes with cells. Here, by tuning lipid
composition in a systematic way, a series of liposomes with tailored surface
properties has been prepared to modulate the corona forming in human serum.
Liposomes with very different cellular uptake kinetics have been obtained and
their corona was identified in order to determine the most enriched proteins on
the different formulations. By combining corona composition and uptake kinetics
candidate corona proteins associated with reduced or increased uptake by cells
can be identified and the liposome formulation can be tuned to obtain the desired
uptake behavior.

Multinodular and vacuolating neuronal tumors (MVNT) are low grade neuronal tumors
classified in cerebral tumors based on 2016 WHO central nerve system
classification. Previously, MVNTs were probably tumors incidentally determined by
imaging methods, but they could not be diagnosed or they were misdiagnosed. Two
cases are reported in the present study, for which radiological imaging was
carried out for epilepsy in one and for headache in the other. The first case was
a twenty seven years old female patient with headache complaint. Brain MRI
examination revealed a clustering lesion of multinodular character located in an 
about 4.0 × 3.5 × 1.5 cm area which had a left
precuneal subcortical-juxtacortical location. The other case was a male patient
with epilepsy. A clustering lesion of multinodular nature was determined in an
area of about 2.0 × 2.0 × 1.5 cm in cortical-subcortical area in corona
radiata-convexity plane of right middle frontal girus. No changes in size or
nature were determined in follow-up examinations. MVNTs are recently defined
tumors, and the characteristic feature for diagnosis of these rare tumor entities
could be a subcortical white matter lesion with satellite nodules that manifest
itself as T2/FLAIRhyperintensity. Increasing number of case reports and studies
in the literature could make the radiological and pathological signs of the
condition clearer.

AIM: Very preterm children born <32 weeks of gestation are at risk for motor
difficulties such as cerebral palsy and developmental coordination disorder. This
study explores the association between diffusion tensor imaging metrics at term
and motor outcomes at 11 years of age.
METHODS: A cohort of 37 very preterm infants (mean gestational age 29 4/7, SD 2
0/7) born in 2004-2006 in Turku University Hospital underwent diffusion tensor
imaging at term. A region of interest analysis of fractional anisotropy and mean 
diffusivity was performed. Motor outcomes at 11 years of age were measured with
the Movement Assessment Battery for Children - Second Edition.
RESULTS: The diffusion metrics of the corpus callosum (genu P = .005, splenium
P = .049), the left corona radiata (P = .035) and the right optic radiation
(P = .017) were related to later motor performance. Mean diffusivity decreased
and fractional anisotropy increased in proportion to the improving performance.
CONCLUSION: The diffusion metrics of the genu and splenium of the corpus
callosum, the left corona radiata and the right optic radiation at term were
associated with motor skills at 11 years of age. Diffusion tensor imaging should 
be further studied as a potential tool in recognising children at risk for motor 
impairment.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can cause 
acute respiratory distress syndrome, hypercoagulability, hypertension, and
multiorgan dysfunction. Effective antivirals with safe clinical profile are
urgently needed to improve the overall prognosis. In an analysis of a randomly
collected cohort of 124 patients with Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), we
found that hypercoagulability as indicated by elevated concentrations of D-dimers
was associated with disease severity. By virtual screening of a U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug library, we identified an anticoagulation
agent dipyridamole (DIP) in silico, which suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication in
vitro. In a proof-of-concept trial involving 31 patients with COVID-19, DIP
supplementation was associated with significantly decreased concentrations of
D-dimers (P<0.05), increased lymphocyte and platelet recovery in the circulation,
and markedly improved clinical outcomes in comparison to the control patients. In
particular, all 8 of the DIP-treated severely ill patients showed remarkable
improvement: 7 patients (87.5%) achieved clinical cure and were discharged from
the hospitals while the remaining 1 patient (12.5%) was in clinical remission.

BACKGROUND: The clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus disease
(COVID-2019) patients outside the epicenter of Hubei Province are less
understood.
METHODS: We analyzed the epidemiological and clinical features of all COVID-2019 
cases in the only referral hospital in Shenzhen City, China, from January 11,
2020, to February 6, 2020, and followed until March 6, 2020.
RESULTS: Among the 298 confirmed cases, 233 (81.5%) had been to Hubei, while 42
(14%) did not have a clear travel history. Only 218 (73.15%) cases had a fever as
the initial symptom. Compared with the nonsevere cases, severe cases were
associated with older age, those with underlying diseases, and higher levels of
C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Slower
clearance of the virus was associated with a higher risk of progression to
critical condition. As of March 6, 2020, 268 (89.9%) patients were discharged and
the overall case fatality ratio was 1.0%.
CONCLUSIONS: In a designated hospital outside Hubei Province, COVID-2019 patients
could be effectively managed by properly using the existing hospital system.
Mortality may be lowered when cases are relatively mild, and there are sufficient
medical resources to care and treat the disease.

PREMISE: Mountain ecosystems are particularly sensitive to climate change.
However, only a very small number of studies exist so far using annually resolved
records of alpine plant growth spanning the past century. Here we aimed to
identify the effects of heat waves and drought, driven by global warming, on
annual radial growth of Rhododendron ferrugineum.
METHODS: We constructed two century-long shrub ring-width chronologies from R.
ferrugineum individuals on two adjacent, north- and west-facing slopes in the
southern French Alps. We analyzed available meteorological data (temperature,
precipitation and drought) over the period 1960-2016. Climate-growth
relationships were evaluated using bootstrapped correlation functions and
structural equation models to identify the effects of rising temperature on shrub
growth.
RESULTS: Analysis of meteorological variables during 1960-2016 revealed a shift
in the late 1980s when heat waves and drought increased in intensity and
frequency. In response to these extreme climate events, shrubs have experienced
significant changes in their main limiting factors. Between 1960 and 1988, radial
growth on both slopes was strongly controlled by the sum of growing degree days
during the snow free period. Between 1989 and 2016, August temperature and
drought have emerged as the most important.
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing air temperatures have caused a shift in the growth
response of shrubs to climate. The recently observed negative effect of high
summer temperature and drought on shrub growth can, however, be buffered by
topographic variability, supporting the macro- and microrefugia hypotheses.

Since late December 2019, a new type of coronavirus (CIVID-19) causing a cluster 
of respiratory infections was first identified in Wuhan-China. And it
disseminated to all countries. Generally, COVID-19 cases have fever, cough,
respiratory distress findings (dyspnoea, intercostal retraction, cyanosis etc.). 
In this paper, we have presented an adult otitis media case whom infected with
COVID-19, but she have not any classical COVID-19 symptoms.

OBJECTIVE: The current study compared the amplitude of transient evoked
otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) and thresholds of pure-tone audiometry between
asymptomatic COVID-19 PCR-positive cases and normal non-infected subjects.
METHODS: Twenty cases who were confirmed positive for COVID-19 and had none of
the known symptoms for this viral infection formed the test group. Their age
ranged between 20 and 50 years to avoid any age-related hearing affection.
Patients who had definite symptoms of COVID-19 infection as well as those who had
a history of hearing loss or a history of any known cause of hearing loss were
excluded from the examined sample. TEOAEs amplitude was measured for all
participants.
RESULTS: The high frequency pure-tone thresholds as well as the TEOAE amplitudes 
were significantly worse in the test group.
CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection could have deleterious effects on cochlear hair
cell functions despite being asymptomatic. The mechanism of these effects
requires further research.

There are few cases of pregnant women with novel corona virus 2019 (COVID-19) in 
the literature, most of them with a mild illness course. There is limited
evidence about in utero infection and early positive neonatal testing. A
41-year-old G3P2 with a history of previous cesarean deliveries and diabetes
mellitus presented with a 4-day history of malaise, low-grade fever, and
progressive shortness of breath. A nasopharyngeal swab was positive for COVID-19,
COVID-19 serology was negative. The patient developed respiratory failure
requiring mechanical ventilation on day 5 of disease onset. The patient underwent
a cesarean delivery, and neonatal isolation was implemented immediately after
birth, without delayed cord clamping or skin-to-skin contact. The neonatal
nasopharyngeal swab, 16 hours after delivery, was positive for severe acute
respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) real-time polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR), and immunoglobulin (Ig)-M and IgG for SARS-CoV-2 were
negative. Maternal IgM and IgG were positive on postpartum day 4 (day 9 after
symptom onset). We report a severe presentation of COVID-19 during pregnancy. To 
our knowledge, this is the earliest reported positive PCR in the neonate, raising
the concern for vertical transmission. We suggest pregnant women should be
considered as a high-risk group and minimize exposures for these reasons. KEY
POINTS: · We report a severe presentation of COVID-19 in pregnancy requiring
invasive ventilatory support.. · This is a case of positive RT-PCR in first day
of life, suggesting possible vertical transmission.. · There were no detectable
maternal antibodies for COVID-19 until after delivery..

Surface modification of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) has significant and
complicated effects on their interactions with cell membranes. In this study, we 
used a lipid/polyacetylene (PDA) vesicle sensor as the lipid membrane model to
evaluate AuNP-lipid membrane interactions. Based on the colorimetric response
(CR) of PDA vesicles before and after incubation with AuNPs, it was found that
the interaction was highly dependent on the surface charge of AuNPs. As compared 
to the positively charged NPs, neutral and zwitterionic NPs adsorbed much less on
the lipid membrane. Negatively charged NPs did not induce any noticeable color
changes even at high concentrations. A class of cationic AuNPs with different
degrees of surface hydrophobicity was further selected to investigate the role of
hydrophobicity in interacting with lipid/PDA vesicles, and log(EC50) was employed
as the evaluation index. According to the log(EC50)-NP concentration curve, the
hydrophobicity of NPs enhanced the lipid membrane affinity, but electrostatic
interactions weakened this effect. Finally, different concentrations of bovine
serum albumin (BSA) were used to study the effect of the protein corona on
NP-lipid membrane interactions. The formation of a NP-protein corona was found to
mask the electrostatic interactions, leading to the decrease of the CR values of 
cationic NPs, and highly hydrophobic NPs were less affected by a low
concentration of BSA due to the strong hydrophobic interactions. Although the
effect of NP surface properties on their interactions with cells is far more
complicated, our study provides a rapid and effective method for the evaluation
of the interactions between surface modified AuNPs and lipid membranes.

[Obstetric Anesthesia During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic - a Brief Overview of
Published Recommendations for Action by National and International Specialist
Societies and Committees].

[Article in German; Abstract available in German from the publisher]

Kranke P, Weibel S, Sitter M, Meybohm P, Girard T.

The most common human corona viruses cause common colds. But three of these
viruses cause more serious, acute diseases; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
(MERS by MERS-CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) by SARS-CoV and
COVID-19 by SARS-CoV-2. The current outbreak was classified by the WHO as a
"global public health emergency". Despite all efforts to reduce the surgical
lists and to cancel or postpone non-time-critical surgical interventions, some
surgical and anesthetic interventions outside of intensive care medicine are
still necessary and must be performed. This is particularly true for obstetric
interventions and neuraxial labor analgesia. Workload in the delivery room is
presumably not going to decrease and planned cesarean sections cannot be
postponed. In the meantime, the clinical course and outcome of some COVID-19
patients with an existing pregnancy or peripartum courses have been reported.
There are already numerous recommendations from national and international bodies
regarding the care of such patients. Some of these recommendations will be
summarized in this manuscript. The selection of aspects should by no means be
seen as a form of prioritization. The general treatment principles in dealing
with COVID-19 patients and the recommendations for action in intensive care
therapy also apply to pregnant and postpartum patients. In this respect, there
are naturally considerable redundancies and only a few aspects apply strictly or 
exclusively to the cohort of obstetric patients. In summary, at present it must
be stated that the general care recommendations that also apply to non-COVID-19
patients are initially valid with regard to obstetric anesthesia. Nevertheless,
the special requirements on the part of hygiene and infection protection result
in special circumstances that should be taken into account when caring for
pregnant patients from an anesthetic point of view. These relate to both medical 
aspects, but also to a particular extent logistics issues with regard to spatial 
separation, staffing and material resources.

Publisher: Die häufigsten menschlichen Coronaviren verursachen unkomplizierte
Erkältungen. Drei dieser Viren jedoch lösen schwerere, akute Krankheiten aus: das
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) durch MERS-CoV, das schwere akute
respiratorische Syndrom (SARS) durch SARS-CoV und COVID-19 durch SARS-CoV-2.
Seitens der WHO wurde der aktuell währende Ausbruch als „global public health
emergency“ eingestuft. Trotz aller Bestrebungen, das OP-Programm zu reduzieren
und nicht zeitkritische operative Eingriffe zunächst abzusagen bzw. zu
verschieben, sind weiter operative Eingriffe und anästhesiologische
Interventionen jenseits der Intensivversorgung notwendig. Dies trifft im
besonderen Maße für geburtshilfliche Eingriffe und die neuraxiale Analgesie im
Rahmen des Spontanpartus zu. So wird der Kreißsaal mutmaßlich unverändert
frequentiert werden und auch „elektive Sectiones“ werden weiterhin stattfinden
müssen. Mittlerweile sind klinischer Verlauf und Outcome einiger
COVID-19-Patientinnen mit bestehender Schwangerschaft bzw. peripartale Verläufe
berichtet worden. Es liegen bereits zahlreiche Empfehlungen nationaler und
internationaler Gremien in Bezug auf die Versorgung solcher Patientinnen vor.
Einige dieser Empfehlungen sollen im Rahmen dieses Beitrages kursorisch dargelegt
werden. Die Auswahl der Aspekte soll keineswegs als eine Form der Priorisierung
angesehen werden. Die allgemeinen Behandlungsgrundsätze im Umgang mit
COVID-19-Patientinnen und die Handlungsempfehlungen zur intensivmedizinischen
Therapie behalten dabei auch für schwangere und postpartale Patientinnen
Gültigkeit. Insofern ergeben sich naturgemäß erhebliche Redundanzen, und nur
wenige Aspekte treffen streng bzw. ausschließlich auf das Kollektiv
geburtshilflicher Patientinnen zu. Zusammenfassend muss zum gegenwärtigen
Zeitpunkt konstatiert werden, dass in der geburtshilflichen Anästhesie zunächst
die allgemeinen Versorgungsempfehlungen gelten, die auch für
Non-COVID-19-Patientinnen geltengültig sind. Gleichwohl ergeben sich durch die
besonderen Vorgaben seitens der Hygiene bzw. des Infektionsschutzes besondere
Umstände, die bei der Versorgung schwangerer Patientinnen berücksichtigt werden
sollten. Diese betreffen neben medizinischen Fragen im Besonderen auch Fragen der
Logistik in Hinblick auf eine räumliche Separierung, die Personalvorhaltung und
materielle Ressourcen.

The protein corona of nanoparticles has in recent years received considerable
attention, and even been postulated to be the missing link in the translation of 
nanomedicines from benchtop to bedside. Here, we highlight the different types of
biological nanoparticles present in blood that need to be considered in the
protein corona research field. We map their size, density and plasma
concentrations and use this information to stress potential challenges related to
the isolation of nanomedicines, with particular focus on liposomes, when using
the traditional isolation methods that separate according to size and density.

SKH1 hairless mice are widely used in carcinogenesis and dermatology research due
to their bare skin, as exposure to different agents is facilitated. Minoxidil is 
a cosmetic drug that is recognized as a mitogenic agent, and mitogens are
suggested to have carcinogenic and mutagenic potential by inducing cell division 
and increasing the possibility of perpetuating DNA damage. Therefore, we
hypothesized that the application of high doses of minoxidil to the skin of
hairless mice would increase the number of micronucleated erythrocytes (MNEs) in 
peripheral blood. The objective of this study was to evaluate the topical
administration of high doses of minoxidil on peripheral blood erythrocytes of
SKH1 mice by means of micronucleus assay. Minoxidil was administered on the
entire body surface of mice every 12 or 24 h. Minoxidil dosing every 24 h
increased the number of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCEs), and
dosing every 12 h increased the number of MNEs and MNPCEs, as compared to
baseline and the negative control group. No decrease in polychromatic erythrocyte
frequencies was observed in the minoxidil groups. Therefore, topical application 
of high minoxidil doses to mice can produce DNA damage, as observed through an
increase in the number of MNEs, without producing cytotoxicity, possibly due to
its mitogenic effect.

This study presents a novel statistical volume element (SVE) for micromechanical 
modeling of the white matter structures, with histology-informed randomized
distribution of axonal tracts within the extracellular matrix. The model was
constructed based on the probability distribution functions obtained from the
results of diffusion tensor imaging as well as the histological observations of
scanning electron micrograph, at two structures of white matter susceptible to
traumatic brain injury, i.e. corpus callosum and corona radiata. A simplistic
representative volume element (RVE) with symmetrical arrangement of fully
alligned axonal fibers was also created as a reference for comparison. A
parametric study was conducted to find the optimum grid and edge size which
ensured the periodicity and ergodicity of the SVE and RVE models. A
multi-objective evolutionary optimization procedure was used to find the
hyperelastic and viscoelastic material constants of the constituents, based on
the experimentally reported responses of corpus callosum to axonal and transverse
loadings. The optimal material properties were then used to predict the
homogenized and localized responses of corpus callosum and corona radiata. The
results indicated similar homogenized responses of the SVE and RVE under
quasi-static extension, which were in good agreement with the experimental data. 
Under shear strain, however, the models exhibited different behaviors, with the
SVE model showing much closer response to the experimental observations.
Moreover, the SVE model displayed a significantly better agreement with the
reports of the experiments at high strain rates. The results suggest that the
randomized fiber architecture has a great influence on the validity of the
micromechanical models of white matter, with a distinguished impact on the
model's response to shear deformation and high strain rates. Moreover, it can
provide a more detailed presentation of the localized responses of the tissue
substructures, including the stress concentrations around the low caliber axonal 
tracts, which is critical for studying the axonal injury mechanisms.

Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus, the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome
(COVID-19), is rapidly spreading around the world. Since the number of corona
positive patients is increasing sharply in Iran, this study aimed to forecast the
number of newly infected patients in the coming days in Iran.
METHODS: The data used in this study were obtained from daily reports of the
Iranian Ministry of Health and the datasets provided by the Johns Hopkins
University including the number of new infected cases from February 19, 2020 to
March 21, 2020. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was
applied to predict the number of patients during the next thirty days.
RESULTS: The ARIMA model forecasted an exponential increase in the number of
newly detected patients. The result of this study also show that if the spreading
pattern continues the same as before, the number of daily new cases would be 3574
by April 20.
CONCLUSION: Since this disease is highly contagious, health politicians need to
make decisions to prevent its spread; otherwise, even the most advanced and
capable health care systems would face problems for treating all infected
patients and a substantial number of deaths will become inevitable.

In the wake of the recent pandemic of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), with 
confirmed cases having crossed 750,000, health systems across the world are
getting overwhelmed; making it strenuous to maintain essential health services.
Several changes were implemented in our acute mental health care service using a 
collaborative approach to maintain a balance between preventive measures to
'flatten the curve' and to provide care to those who were in need. Mode of
service delivery was changed predominantly to tele-medicine, amongst others. It
was found to be a workable model, albeit further follow up will be required to
better understand its viability and feasibility to withstand the COVID-19
cataclysm.

Novel Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) originating from China has rapidly crossed 
borders, infecting people throughout the whole world. This phenomenon has led to 
a massive public reaction; the media has been reporting continuously across
borders to keep all informed about the pandemic situation. All these things are
creating a lot of concern for people leading to heightened levels of anxiety.
Pandemics can lead to heightened levels of stress; Anxiety is a common response
to any stressful situation. This study attempted to assess the knowledge,
attitude, anxiety experience, and perceived mental healthcare need among adult
Indian population during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey was conducted
using a semi-structured questionnaire using a non-probability snowball sampling
technique. A total of 662 responses were received. The responders had a moderate 
level of knowledge about the COVID-19 infection and adequate knowledge about its 
preventive aspects. The attitude towards COVID-19 showed peoples' willingness to 
follow government guidelines on quarantine and social distancing. The anxiety
levels identified in the study were high. More than 80 % of the people were
preoccupied with the thoughts of COVID-19 and 72 % reported the need to use
gloves, and sanitizers. In this study, sleep difficulties, paranoia about
acquiring COVID-19 infection and distress related social media were reported in
12.5 %, 37.8 %, and 36.4 % participants respectively. The perceived mental
healthcare need was seen in more than 80 % of participants. There is a need to
intensify the awareness and address the mental health issues of people during
this COVID-19 pandemic.

This study is aimed to assess the anxiety level of Iranian general population
during COVID-19 outbreak. The online questionnaire surveyed 10,754 individuals
from the general population of 31 provinces of Iran who completed the
questionnaire on social networks from March 1 to March 9, 2020. The inferential
statistics suggests that the level of anxiety was higher among women (95 % CI
[0.1, 81.36], p < 0.001), people who more followed corona-related news
(p < 0.001) and the age group of 21-40 years (p < 0.001). Ultimately, the level
of anxiety was significantly higher among people who had at least one family
member, relative, or friend who contracted COVID-19 disease (95 % CI [1.2,
35.03], p < 0.001). The health care system should adopt a package of psychosocial
interventions to reduce the anxiety of high risk groups.

Altered brain structures have been found in patients with schizo-obsessive
disorder, schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder in previous studies.
However, it is unclear whether similar brain changes are also found in
individuals with high schizo-obsessive traits (SOT), high schizotypal traits
(SCT) and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS). We examined grey matter volume
(GMV) and white matter integrity (WMI, including fractional anisotropy, mean
diffusivity, axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity) in 26 individuals with
high SOT, 30 individuals with high SCT, 25 individuals with OCS and 30
individuals with low trait scores (LT) in this study. Correlation analysis
between GMV, WMI, Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) scores and
Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R) scores in the subclinical groups
was also carried out. We found that the SOT group exhibited increased GMV at the 
right superior occipital gyrus and the left postcentral gyrus compared with the
LT group. The SCT group exhibited increased GMV at the right precentral gyrus and
the bilateral cuneus compared with the LT group, and decreased fractional
anisotropy at the anterior corona radiata compared with the other three groups.
The OCS group exhibited increased GMV at the left superior temporal gyrus and
decreased GMV at the left pre-supplementary motor area compared with the LT
group. These ﬁndings highlight specific brain changes in individuals with high
SOT, high SCT and OCS, and may thus provide new insights into the neurobiological
changes that occur in sub-clinical populations of these disorders.

The world is reeling under the crisis caused by corona virus disease (COVID-19), 
print, electronic and social media are flooded with numerous advisories issued by
governments and other national & international agencies. While all this is being 
done with best of intentions so as to contain the spread of this viral disease,
this is causing a significant negative impact on mental health of people
specially person of obsessive-compulsive disorder with fear of contamination and 
excessive washing of hands.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze how governments, hospitals and information technology(IT)
companies use Internet technology to provide online health services during the
early stage of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in January 2020 in
China, and then provide suggestions and coping strategies for the later stage and
post-epidemic time.
METHODS: We searched for information on ehealth services related to the outbreak 
of COVID-19 in China. The sources of information were mainstream search engines
such as Baidu and the popular interactive social platforms such as Webchat. The
keywords were "Internet+pneumonia", "Internet clinic", "pneumonia online clinic" 
and so on. The time of information was from January 20 to February 3, 2020. The
key information was extracted and encoded by two persons back-to-back. The coding
information included: name of organization provider, launching time, location of 
provider, service items, user, health workers engaging in the service, and so on.
The coded information was entered and analyzed with SPSS 24.0 and Excel.
RESULTS: There were totally 57 projects launched by local governments, hospitals 
and IT companies. Most of them were launched from January 24th to 27th, the
hospital and government projects services regionally, especially in eastern
provinces. In this study, 90.48% of the enterprises and 100.00% of the hospitals 
had online fever clinic and consultation services for COVID-19, 66.67% of the
enterprises and 37.04% of the hospitals serviced derivative health problems. Only
a few projects provided tele-medical consultation. There were individual projects
that provided online health management for home quarantine people. Physicians
were the main force of various projects. In some hospital projects, there were
also nurses, pharmacists and professional technicians to provide featured
consultation.
CONCLUSION: Ehealth is useful and helpful for the health care system to rapidly
cope with health demand during instantaneous and post epidemic time. Regional
distribution of ehealth is unbalanced. There are institutional and technical
feasibilities for the emergency application of Internet technology. However,
community health centers seldom provide ehealth or connect with tertiary
hospitals with Internet. Therefore, all kinds of providers within healthcare
system should promote emergence ehealth. Tele-medical diagnosis and referral
should be developed by local governments during COVID-19. The application of
"Internet+medical treatment" in community medical institutions and synergy among 
various institutions should be promoted.

Inorganic materials are receiving significant interest in medicine given their
usefulness for therapeutic applications such as targeted drug delivery, active
pharmaceutical carriers and medical imaging. However, poor knowledge of the side 
effects related to their use is an obstacle to clinical translation. For the
development of molecular drugs, the concept of safe-by-design has become an
efficient pharmaceutical strategy with the aim of reducing costs, which can also 
accelerate the translation into the market. In the case of materials, the
application these approaches is hampered by poor knowledge of how the physical
and chemical properties of the material trigger the biological response.
Hemocompatibility is a crucial aspect to take into consideration for those
materials that are intended for medical applications. The formation of
nanoparticle agglomerates can cause severe side effects that may induce occlusion
of blood vessels and thrombotic events. Additionally, nanoparticles can interfere
with the coagulation cascade causing both pro- and anti-coagulant properties.
There is contrasting evidence on how the physicochemical properties of the
material modulate these effects. In this work, we developed two sets of tailored 
carbon and silica nanoparticles with three different diameters in the 100-500 nm 
range with the purpose of investigating the role of surface curvature and
chemistry on platelet aggregation, activation and adhesion. Substantial
differences were found in the composition of the protein corona depending on the 
chemical nature of the nanoparticles, while the surface curvature was found to
play a minor role. On the other hand, large carbon nanoparticles (but not small
carbon nanoparticles or silica nanoparticles) have a clear tendency to form
aggregates both in plasma and blood. This effect was observed both in the
presence or absence of platelets and was independent of platelet activation.
Overall, the results presented herein suggest the existence of independent modes 
of action that are differently affected by the physicochemical properties of the 
materials, potentially leading to vessel occlusion and/or formation of thrombi in
vivo.

The outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2
infection is spreading globally and quickly, leading to emerging health issues.
SARS-CoV-2 enters into and infects host cells through its spike glycoprotein
recognizing the cell receptor Angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). Here, we
noticed that ACE2 was further enhanced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Human germ cells 
and early embryos express high level of ACE2. Notably, RNA-seq result showed that
reduction of H3K27me3, but not H3K4/9/36me3, led to upregulation of Ace2
expression in mouse germ cell line GC-2. In agreement with this result, we found 
in human embryonic stem cells that ACE2 expression was significantly increased in
absence of EZH2, the major enzyme catalyzing H3K27me3. ChIP-seq analysis further 
confirmed decrease of H3K27me3 signal and increase of H3K27ac signal at ACE2
promoter upon EZH2 knockout. Therefore, we propose that EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 at
ACE2 promoter region inhibits ACE2 expression in mammalian cells. This regulatory
pattern may also exist in other human cells and tissues. Our discovery provides
clues for pathogenesis and targeted drug therapy towards ACE2 expression for
prevention and adjuvant therapy of COVID-19.

Intracellular Generation of Superoxide by TiO2 Nanoparticles Decreases Histone
Deacetylase 9 (HDAC9), an Epigenetic Modifier.

Jayaram DT(1), Payne CK(1).

Durham, North Carolina 27708, United States.

Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles are used on a massive scale in commercial
and industrial products. Of specific concern is how the inhalation of these
nanoparticles in a manufacturing setting may affect human health. We examine the 
cellular response to TiO2 nanoparticles using a combination of cell-free
spectroscopic assays, fluorescence microscopy, Western blotting, and TiO2
nanoparticle surface modifications. These experiments show that TiO2
nanoparticles generate superoxide, both in solution and in cells, and this
intracellular superoxide decreases expression of histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9),
an epigenetic modifier. We use protein coronas formed from superoxide dismutase
(SOD) and catalase, enzymes that scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS), to probe
the relationship between TiO2 nanoparticles, ROS, and the subsequent cellular
response. These protein coronas provide nanoparticle-localized scavengers that
demonstrate that the nanoparticles are the source of the intracellular
superoxide. Importantly, the use of a SOD corona or surface passivated TiO2
nanoparticles prevents the decrease of HDAC9. These experiments elucidate the
underlying mechanism of TiO2 nanoparticle-mediated cellular responses including
oxidative stress and changes in gene expression. They also provide the first
demonstration of a protein corona as a tool for probing cellular responses to
nanoparticles. Overall, this research shows that low, nontoxic concentrations of 
TiO2 nanoparticles alter an enzyme responsible for epigenetic modifications,
which points to concerns regarding long-term exposures in manufacturing settings.

The protein corona does not influence receptor-mediated targeting of virus-like
particles.

Zackova Suchanova J, Hejtmánková A, Neburkova J, Cígler P, Forstova J, Španielová
H.

Protein corona formation has been regarded as an obstacle to developing
diagnostic and therapeutic nanoparticles for in vivo applications. Serum proteins
that assemble around nanoparticles can hinder their targeting efficiency.
Virus-based nanoparticles should be naturally predisposed to evade such barriers 
in host organisms. Here, we demonstrate that virus-like particles derived from
mouse polyomavirus do not form a rich protein corona. These particles can be
efficiently targeted to cells that overproduce transferrin receptors, e.g. cancer
cells, by conjugating transferrin to the particle surface. In this study, we
provide evidence that the interaction of virus-like particles with their newly
assigned target receptor is not obstructed by serum proteins. The particles enter
target cells via a clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway that is not naturally
used by the virus. Our results support the notion that the natural properties of 
virus-like particles make them well-suited for development of nanosized
theranostic tools resistant to de-targeting by protein coronas.

Direct Comparison of Polyethylene Glycol and Phosphoryl Choline Drug-loaded
Nanoparticles In Vitro and In Vivo.

Noy JM, Chen F, Akhter DT, Houston ZH, Fletcher NL, Thurecht KJ, Stenzel MH.

Phosphorylcholine is known to repel the absorption of proteins onto surfaces,
which can prevent the formation of a protein corona on the surface of
nanoparticles. This can influence the fate of nanoparticles used for drug
delivery. This material could therefore serve as an alternative to poly(ethylene 
glycol) (PEG). Herein, the synthesis of different particles prepared by
polymerization induced self-assembly (PISA) coated with either poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG) or zwitterionic 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) and 
PENAO were reported. The anti-cancer drug PENAO
(4-(N-(S-penicillaminylacetyl)amino) phenylarsenonous acid) was conjugated to the
shell-forming block. Interactions of the different coated nanoparticles - that
represent comparable sizes and size distributions (76 - 85 nm, PDI = 0.0067 -
0.0094) - with 2D and 3D cultured cells were studied and their cytotoxicity,
cellular uptake, spheroid penetration and cell localization profile was analyzed.
While only a minimal difference between the nanoparticles for the conducted in
vitro experiments were seen (with PEG-co-PENAO coated micelles showing slightly
higher cytotoxicity, better spheroid penetration and cell localization ability), 
the study was amplified when in vivo biodistribution studies were conducted.
After 1 hour postinjection, the majority of the MPC-co-PENAO coated nanoparticles
were found to accumulate in the liver, making this particle system unfeasible for
future studies.

BACKGROUND: The fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is the second most commonly used 
colorectal cancer (CRC) screening modality in the United States; yet, follow-up
of abnormal FIT results with diagnostic colonoscopy is underutilized. Our
objective was to determine patient-reported barriers to diagnostic colonoscopy
following abnormal FIT in an academic healthcare setting.
METHODS: We included patients age 50-75 with an abnormal FIT result between
1/1/2015 and 10/31/2017 and no documented follow-up diagnostic colonoscopy. We
abstracted demographic data from the electronic health record (EHR). Study
personnel conducted telephone surveys with patients to confirm colonoscopy
completion and elicit data on notification of FIT results and barriers to
colonoscopy. We also provided brief verbal education about diagnostic
colonoscopy. We calculated frequencies of demographic data and survey responses
and compared survey responses by interest in colonoscopy after education.
RESULTS: We surveyed 67 patients. Fifty-one were aware of the abnormal FIT
result, and a majority learned of the abnormal FIT result by direct communication
with providers (19, 37.3%) or EHR messaging (11, 21.6%). Overall, fifty-three
patients (79.1%) confirmed lack of colonoscopy, citing provider-related (19,
35.8%), patient-related (16, 30.2%), system-related (1, 1.9%), or multifactorial 
(17, 32.1%) reasons. Lack of knowledge of FIT result (14, 26.4%) was most common.
After brief education, 20 (37.7%) patients requested colonoscopy.
CONCLUSION: Patients with an abnormal FIT reported various multi-level barriers
to diagnostic colonoscopy after abnormal FIT, including knowledge of FIT results.
When provided with brief education, participants expressed interest in diagnostic
colonoscopy. Future efforts will evaluate interventions to improve colonoscopy
follow-up.

BACKGROUND: Anomalies of pyramidal tract decussation are rare phenomena that can 
be caused by ectodermal dysplasia. Herein, we describe a patient with ichthyosis 
who exhibited ipsilateral hemiparesis after stroke and whose neuroimaging results
showed evidence of motor control being provided by the ipsilateral motor cortex.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 24-year-old right-handed man presented with skin
abnormalities, sudden-onset left hemiparesis, and dysarthria. He exhibited a
mild-to-moderate left-sided weakness (grade 4 on the Medical Research Council
scale). Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an acute infarct in the left corona
radiata. Diffusion tensor imaging revealed uncrossed corticospinal tracts.
Next-generation sequencing identified heterozygous FLG mutations. The patient was
diagnosed with cerebral infarction and ichthyosis vulgaris and was treated with
aspirin (100 mg/d). His symptoms gradually dissipated.
CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that pyramidal decussation anomalies can be
associated with ichthyosis. Patients with ichthyosis should therefore be
evaluated for nerve involvement.

We explored the relationships between lymphocyte subsets, cytokines, pulmonary
inflammation index (PII) and disease evolution in patients with (corona virus
disease 2019) COVID-19. A total of 123 patients with COVID-19 were divided into
mild and severe groups. Lymphocyte subsets and cytokines were detected on the
first day of hospital admission and lung computed tomography results were
quantified by PII. Difference analysis and correlation analysis were performed on
the two groups. A total of 102 mild and 21 severe patients were included in the
analysis. There were significant differences in cluster of differentiation 4
(CD4+ T), cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8+ T), interleukin 6 (IL-6),
interleukin 10 (IL-10) and PII between the two groups. There were significant
positive correlations between CD4+ T and CD8+ T, IL-6 and IL-10 in the mild group
(r2  = 0·694, r 2  = 0·633, respectively; P < 0·01). After 'five-in-one'
treatment, all patients were discharged with the exception of the four who died. 
Higher survival rates occurred in the mild group and in those with IL-6 within
normal values. CD4+ T, CD8+ T, IL-6, IL-10 and PII can be used as indicators of
disease evolution, and the PII can be used as an independent indicator for
disease progression of COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION: Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) has been considered essential
for the staging of breast cancer (BC). As the impact of tumor biology on clinical
outcomes is recognized, a surgical de-escalation approach is being implemented.
We performed a retrospective study focused on surgical management of the axilla
in invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) versus invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 1151 newly diagnosed BCs, IDCs (79.6%) or ILCs (20.4%),
were selected among patients treated at our Breast Cancer Unit from 2012 to 2018.
Tumor characteristics and clinical information were collected and predictors of
further metastasis after positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) analyzed in
relation to disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: 27.5% of patients with ILC had ≥ 3 metastatic lymph nodes at ALND after 
positive SLNB versus 11.48% of IDCs (p = 0.04). Risk predictors of further
metastasis at ALND were the presence of > 2 positive lymph nodes at SLNB
(OR = 4.72, 95% CI 1.15-19.5 p = 0.03), T3-T4 tumors (OR = 4.93, 95% CI
1.10-22.2, p = 0.03) and Non-Luminal BC (OR = 2.74, 95% CI 1.16-6.50, p = 0.02). 
The lobular histotype was not associated with the risk of further metastasis at
ALND (OR = 1.62, 95% CI 0.77-3.41, p = 0.20).
CONCLUSIONS: ILC histology is not associated with higher risk of further
metastasis at ALND in our analysis. However, surgical management decisions should
be taken considering tumor histotype, biology and expected sensitivity to
adjuvant therapies.

Once nanoparticles (NPs) contact with the biological fluids, the proteins
immediately adsorb onto their surface, forming a layer called protein corona
(PC), which bestows the biological identity on NPs. Importantly, the NPs-PC
complex is the true identity of NPs in physiological environment. Based on the
affinity and the binding and dissociation rate, PC is classified into soft
protein corona, hard protein corona, and interfacial protein corona. Especially, 
the hard PC, a protein layer relatively stable and closer to their surface, plays
particularly important role in the biological effects of the complex. However,
the abundant corona proteins rarely correspond to the most abundant proteins
found in biological fluids. The composition profile, formation and conformational
change of PC can be affected by many factors. Here, the influence factors, not
only the nature of NPs, but also surface chemistry and biological medium, are
discussed. Likewise, the formed PC influences the interaction between NPs and
cells, and the associated subsequent cellular uptake and cytotoxicity. The
uncontrolled PC formation may induce undesirable and sometimes opposite results: 
increasing or inhibiting cellular uptake, hindering active targeting or
contributing to passive targeting, mitigating or aggravating cytotoxicity, and
stimulating or mitigating the immune response. In the present review, we discuss 
these aspects and hope to provide a valuable reference for controlling protein
adsorption, predicting their behavior in vivo experiments and designing lower
toxicity and enhanced targeting nanomedical materials for nanomedicine.

OBJECTIVE: Since December 2019, an outbreak of corona virus disease 2019
(COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread to almost all parts of China.
This was followed by prevention programs recommending Chinese medicine (CM) for
the prevention. In order to provide evidence for CM recommendations, we reviewed 
ancient classics and human studies.
METHODS: Historical records on prevention and treatment of infections in CM
classics, clinical evidence of CM on the prevention of severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 influenza, and CM prevention programs issued by health
authorities in China since the COVID-19 outbreak were retrieved from different
databases and websites till 12 February, 2020. Research evidence included data
from clinical trials, cohort or other population studies using CM for preventing 
contagious respiratory virus diseases.
RESULTS: The use of CM to prevent epidemics of infectious diseases was traced
back to ancient Chinese practice cited in Huangdi's Internal Classic (Huang Di
Nei Jing) where preventive effects were recorded. There were 3 studies using CM
for prevention of SARS and 4 studies for H1N1 influenza. None of the participants
who took CM contracted SARS in the 3 studies. The infection rate of H1N1
influenza in the CM group was significantly lower than the non-CM group (relative
risk 0.36, 95% confidence interval 0.24-0.52; n=4). For prevention of COVID-19,
23 provinces in China issued CM programs. The main principles of CM use were to
tonify qi to protect from external pathogens, disperse wind and discharge heat,
and resolve dampness. The most frequently used herbs included Radix astragali
(Huangqi), Radix glycyrrhizae (Gancao), Radix saposhnikoviae (Fangfeng), Rhizoma 
Atractylodis Macrocephalae (Baizhu), Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (Jinyinhua), and
Fructus forsythia (Lianqiao).
CONCLUSIONS: Based on historical records and human evidence of SARS and H1N1
influenza prevention, Chinese herbal formula could be an alternative approach for
prevention of COVID-19 in high-risk population. Prospective, rigorous population 
studies are warranted to confirm the potential preventive effect of CM.

Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted health and economy
worldwide on an unprecedented scale. Patients have diverse clinical outcomes, but
those with pre-existing cardiovascular (CV) disease, hypertension, and related
conditions incur disproportionately worse outcome. The high infectivity of the
SARS-CoV-2 virus is in part related to new mutations in the receptor binding
domain, and acquisition of a furin cleavage site in the S spike protein. The
continued viral shedding in the asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals
enhances its community transmission. The virus uses the ACE2 receptor for
internalization, aided by TMPRSS2 protease. The tissue localization of the
receptors correlates with COVDI-19 presenting symptoms and organ dysfunction.
Virus-induced ACE2 down regulation may attenuate its function, diminish its
anti-inflammatory role, and heightened angiotensin II effects in the predisposed 
patients. Lymphopenia occurs early and is prognostic, potentially associated with
reduction of the CD4+ and some CD8+ T cells. This leads to imbalance of the
innate/acquired immune response, delayed viral clearance, and hyper stimulated
macrophages and neutrophils. Appropriate type I interferon pathway activation is 
critical for virus attenuation, and balanced immune response. Persistent immune
activation in predisposed patients, such as the elderly and those with CV risk,
can lead to hemophagocytosis like syndrome, with uncontrolled amplification of
cytokine production, leading to multi-organ failure and death. In addition to the
airways and lungs, the cardiovascular system is often involved in COVID-19 early,
reflected in the release of highly sensitive troponin and natriuretic peptides,
which are all extremely prognostic, particularly in those showing continued rise,
along with cytokines such as IL-6. Inflammation in the vascular system can result
in diffuse microangiopathy with thrombosis. Inflammation in the myocardium can
result in myocarditis, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, acute coronary
syndrome, rapid deterioration and sudden death. Aggressive support based on early
prognostic indicators with expectant management can potentially improve recovery.
Appropriate treatment for heart failure, arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome and
thrombosis remain important. Specific evidence based treatment strategies for
COVID-19 will emerge with ongoing global collaboration on multiple approaches
being evaluated. To protect the wider population, antibody testing and effective 
vaccine will be needed to make COVID-19 history.

BACKGROUND: Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) has spread widely throughout the
world since the end of 2019. Nucleic acid testing (NAT) has played an important
role in patient diagnosis and management of COVID-19. In some circumstances,
thermal inactivation at 56 °C has been recommended to inactivate Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) before NAT. However, this
procedure could theoretically disrupt nucleic acid integrity of this
single-stranded RNA virus and cause false negatives in real-time polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) tests.
METHODS: We investigated whether thermal inactivation could affect the results of
viral NAT. We examined the effects of thermal inactivation on the quantitative
RT-PCR results of SARS-CoV-2 particularly with regard to the rates of
false-negative results for specimens carrying low viral loads. We additionally
investigated the effects of different specimen types, sample preservation times
and a chemical inactivation approach on NAT.
RESULTS: Our work showed increased Ct values in specimens from diagnosed COVID-19
patients in RT-PCR tests after thermal incubation. Moreover, about half of the
weak-positive samples (7 of 15 samples, 46.7%) were RT-PCR negative after heat
inactivation in at least one parallel testing. The use of guanidinium-based lysis
for preservation of these specimens had a smaller impact on RT-PCR results with
fewer false negatives (2 of 15 samples, 13.3%) and significantly less increase in
Ct values than heat inactivation.
CONCLUSION: Thermal inactivation adversely affected the efficiency of RT-PCR for 
SARS-CoV-2 detection. Given the limited applicability associated with chemical
inactivators, other approaches to ensure the overall protection of laboratory
personnel need consideration.

Recently, the number of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases has increased 
remarkably in South Korea, so the triage clinics and emergency departments (ED)
are expected to be overcrowded with patients with presumed infection. As of March
21st, there was a total of 8,799 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 102 related
deaths in South Korea that was one of the top countries with high incidence rates
[1]. This sharp increase in infection is associated with 1) outbreaks in
individual provinces, 2) deployment of rapid and aggressive screening tests, 3)
dedicated healthcare staffs for virus screening tests, 4) quarantine inspection
data transparency and accurate data reporting, and 5) public health lessons from 
previous Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks. This commentary introduces innovative screening tests 
that are currently used in South Korea for COVID-19, e.g., Drive-Through and
Walk-Through tests, and compare the advantages and disadvantages of both methods.

In the hands of experienced examiners, the contrast enhanced sonography (CEUS)
offers the possibility to analyze dynamic microcirculatory disturbances in real
time dynamically without any risk for kidneys and thyroid gland even in severe
progressing disease bedside. Based on severe COVID-19 infections, first
experiences with abdominal CEUS examinations are presented. In the stage of an
imminent organ failure with significantly reduced kidney and liver function, CEUS
can be used to show a narrowing of the organ-supplying arteries, as well as a
delayed capillary filling of vessels near the capsule, a regional reduced
parenchymal perfusion or an inflammatory hyperemia with capillary
hypercirculation. It is possible to quickly rule out organ infarction and to
dynamically record the mesenteric arterial and venous blood flow.

OBJECTIVE: In December, 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause
emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China. In this study, we investigate clinical and
laboratory features and short-term outcomes of patients with Corona Virus Disease
2019(COVID-19).
METHODS: All patients with COVID-19 admitted to Wuhan University Zhongnan
Hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 3 and February 1, 2020 were included.
All those patients were with laboratory-confirmed infection. Epidemiological,
clinical, radiological characteristics, underlying diseases, laboratory tests
treatment, complications and outcomes data were collected. Outcomes were followed
up at discharge until Feb 15, 2020.
RESULTS: The study cohort included 102 adult patients. The median (IQR) age was
54 years (37-67years) and 48.0% were female. A total of 34 patients (33.3%) were 
exposed to source of transmission in the hospital setting (as health care
workers, patients, or visitors) and 10 patients (9.8%) had a familial cluster.
Eighteen patients (17.6%) were admitted to the ICU, and 17 patients died
(mortality, 16.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.4%-23.9%). Among patients who 
survived, they were younger, more likely were health care workers and less likely
suffered from comorbidities. They were also less likely suffered from
complications. There was no difference in drug treatment rates between the
survival and non-survival groups. Patients who survived less likely required
admission to the intensive care unit (14.1% vs. 35.3%). Chest imaging examination
showed that death patients more likely had ground-glass opacity (41.2% vs.
12.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: The mortality rate was high among the COVID-19 patients described in
our cohort who met our criteria for inclusion in this analysis. Patient
characteristics seen more frequently in those who died were development of
systemic complications following onset of the illness and the severity of disease
requiring admission to the ICU. Our data support those described by others that
COVID-19 infection results from human-to-human transmission, including familial
clustering of cases, and nosocomial transmission. There were no differences in
mortality among those who did or did not receive antimicrobial or glucocorticoid 
drug treatment.

BACKGROUND: The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the corona virus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) has been rapidly spreading nationwide and abroad. A serologic test
to identify antibody dynamics and response to SARS-CoV-2 was developed.
METHODS: The antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected by an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the recombinant nucleocapsid protein of
SARS-CoV-2 in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 at 3-40 days after
symptom onset. The gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis was nucleic acid testing 
for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. The serodiagnostic power of the specific IgM and IgG
antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was investigated in terms of sensitivity,
specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and
consistency rate.
RESULTS: The seroconversion of specific IgM and IgG antibodies were observed as
early as the 4th day after symptom onset. In the confirmed patients with
COVID-19, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and consistency rate of IgM were
77.3% (51/66), 100%, 100%, 80.0%, and 88.1%, and those of IgG were 83.3.3%
(55/66), 95.0%, 94.8%, 83.8%, and 88.9 %. In patients with suspected COVID-19,
sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and consistency rate of IgM were 87.5%
(21/24), 100%, 100%, 95.2%, and 96.4%, and those of IgG were 70.8% (17/24),
96.6%, 85.0%, 89.1%, and 88.1%. Both antibodies performed well in serodiagnosis
for COVID-19 rely on great specificity.
CONCLUSIONS: The antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the middle and 
later stage of the illness. Antibody detection may play an important role in the 
diagnosis of COVID-19 as complement approach for viral nucleid acid assays.

BACKGROUND: Due to no reliable risk stratification tool for severe coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients at admission, we aimed to construct an effective
model for early identification of cases at high risk of progression to severe
COVID-19.
METHODS: In this retrospective three-centers study, 372 non-severe COVID-19
patients during hospitalization were followed for more than 15 days after
admission. Patients who deteriorated to severe or critical COVID-19 and patients 
who kept non-severe state were assigned to the severe and non-severe group,
respectively. Based on baseline data of the two groups, we constructed a risk
prediction nomogram for severe COVID-19 and evaluated its performance.
RESULTS: The training cohort consisted of 189 patients, while the two independent
validation cohorts consisted of 165 and 18 patients. Among all cases, 72 (19.35%)
patients developed severe COVID-19. We found that old age, and higher serum
lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, the coefficient of variation of red
blood cell distribution width, blood urea nitrogen, direct bilirubin, lower
albumin, are associated with severe COVID-19. We generated the nomogram for early
identifying severe COVID-19 in the training cohort (AUC 0.912 [95% CI
0.846-0.978], sensitivity 85.71%, specificity 87.58%); in validation cohort
(0.853 [0.790-0.916], 77.5%, 78.4%). The calibration curve for probability of
severe COVID-19 showed optimal agreement between prediction by nomogram and
actual observation. Decision curve and clinical impact curve analysis indicated
that nomogram conferred high clinical net benefit.
CONCLUSION: Our nomogram could help clinicians to early identify patients who
will exacerbate to severe COVID-19, which will enable better centralized
management and early treatment of severe patients.

OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Umifenovir (Arbidol®) is an
antiviral drug being used to treat influenza in Russia and China. This study
aimed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of umifenovir for COVID-19.
METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in non-ICU Ward in Jinyintan
Hospital from February 2, 2020 to March 20, 2020. COVID-19 was confirmed by
real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay for
pharyngeal swab specimens. The confirmed patients were divided into umifenovir
group and control group according to the use of umifenovir. The main outcomes
were the negative rate of pharyngeal swab's test for SARS-CoV-2 within 1 week
after admission, as well as the duration for virus turning negative. The
negativity time of SARS-CoV-2 was defined as the first day of a negative test if 
the nucleid acid of SARS-CoV-2 was negative for 2 consecutive tests.
RESULTS: A total of 81 COVID-19 patients were included, with 45 in umifenovir
group and 36 in control group. Baseline clinical, laboratory characteristics were
comparable between two groups. 33/45 (73.3%) patients in umifenovir group were
tested negative in SARS-CoV-2 within 7 days after admission, the number was 28/36
(77.8%) in control group (p=0.19). The median time from onset of symtoms to
SARS-CoV-2 turning negative were 18 days (interquartile range [IQR] 12-21) in
umifenovir group and 16 days (IQR, 11-21) in control group (p= 0.42). Patients in
umifenovir group had longer hospital stay than patients in control group (13 days
[IQR, 9-17] vs 11 days [IQR, 9-14], p=0.04). No deaths or severe adverse reaction
were found in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Umifenovir might not improve the prognosis or accelerate the
SARS-CoV-2 clearance in non-ICU patients. A randomized control clinical trial is 
needed to assess the efficacy of umifenovir.

This study aimed to develop sheddable polyethylene glycol (PEG) shells with
TAT-modified core cross-linked nanomicelles as drug-delivery carriers of
doxorubicin (DOX) to establish a programmed response against the tumor
microenvironment, enhanced endocytosis, and lysosomal pH-triggered DOX release.
First, poly(L-succinimide) (PSI) underwent a ring-opening reaction with
ethylenediamine to generate poly(N-(2-aminoethyl)-l-aspartamide) (P(ae-Asp)).
Next, the thiolytic cleavable PEG, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and TAT were
grafted onto P(ae-Asp) to synthesize the amphiphilic graft copolymer of
mPEG-SS-g-P(ae-Asp)-MCA-DA-TAT. In aqueous solution, the amphiphilic polymer
self-assembled into nanomicelles, encapsulating DOX into the hydrophobic core of 
micelles. TAT was shielded by the PEG corona during circulation to avoid
non-specific transmembrane interaction with normal cells, while the tumor redox
environment-responsive shedding of PEG could expose TAT to promote
internalization of tumor cells. In order to improve the stability of nanomicelles
and achieve pH-triggered drug release, a core cross-linking strategy based on the
coordination of catechol and Fe3+ was adopted. In vitro studies demonstrated that
core cross-linked nanomicelles maintained the nanostructure in 100 times dilution
in pH 7.4 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Moreover, DOX release from DOX-loaded 
core cross-linked nanomicelles (DOX-TAT-CCLMs) was favored at simulated lysosomal
conditions over simulated plasma conditions, indicating that these nanomicelles
demonstrate characteristics of pH-triggered DOX release. The TAT modification
considerably enhanced the mean fluorescence intensity of the nanomicelles
endocytosed by MCF-7/ADR cells by 8 times, compared with DOX·HCl after 8 h of
incubation. Notably, the IC50 value of nanomicelles (11.61 ± 0.95 μg/mL) was
nearly 4 times lower than that of DOX·HCl against MCF-7/ADR cells, implying that 
the nanomicelles could overcome drug resistance observed in MCF-7/ADR cells.
Furthermore, the DOX-TAT-CCLMs reported superior tumor growth suppression in a
4T1 tumor-bearing mouse model. Thus, the redox- and pH- stimuli
stepwise-responsive novel nanomicelles fabricated from the
mPEG-SS-g-P(ae-Asp)-MCA-DA-TAT graft copolymer exhibited multifunctionality and
displayed great potential for drug delivery.

Nanoparticles (NPs) based on biocompatible and biodegradable polymers such as
poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and polycaprolactone (PCL) represent
effective systems for systemic drug delivery. Upon injection into the blood
circuit, the NP surface is rapidly modified due to adsorption of proteins that
form a 'protein corona' (PC). The PC plays an important role in cellular
targeting, uptake and NP bio-distribution. Hence, the study of interactions
between NPs and serum proteins appears as key for biomedical applications and
safety of NPs. In the present work, we report on the comparative protein
fluorescence quenching extent, thermodynamics of protein binding and
identification of proteins in the soft and hard corona layers of PLGA and PCL
NPs. NPs were prepared via a single emulsion-solvent evaporation technique and
characterized with respect to size, zeta potential, surface morphology and
hydrophobicity. Protein fluorescence quenching experiments were performed against
human serum albumin. The thermodynamics of serum protein binding onto the NPs was
studied using isothermal titration calorimetry. Semi-quantitative analysis of
proteins in the PC layers was conducted using gel electrophoresis and mass
spectrometry using human serum. Our results demonstrated the influence of
particle hydrophobicity on the thermodynamics of protein binding. Human serum
proteins bind to a greater extent and with greater affinity to PCL NPs than PLGA 
NPs. Several proteins were detected in the hard and soft corona of the NPs,
representing their unique proteome fingerprints. Some proteins were unique to the
PCL NPs. We anticipate that our findings will assist with rational design of
polymeric NPs for effective drug delivery applications.

Patients with Covid-19 disease commonly present with symptoms related to
respiratory illness, and less commonly they develop cardiovascular complications 
either on presentation or during the course of the disease. The
mortality/morbidity is high in these patients with cardiovascular
involvement. Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a medical
emergency which needs immediate coronary re-perfusion for better patient
outcomes. Here we present a patient who presented to the emergency room with
acute STEMI and later tested positive for COVID-19. She was successfully treated 
with coronary revascularization and stent placement, and remains on the
ventilator to date as she quickly developed acute respiratory distress syndrome. 
We need more research in Covid-19 patients with cardiovascular involvement for
early diagnosis, prevention of exposure to health care workers and effective
treatment.

Saliva is an exocrine secretion produced from the salivary glands and has
numerous functions, such as cleansing and protection of the oral cavity,
antimicrobial effects and aids in digestion. Due to the speedy development in the
field of salivaomics, saliva is now well accepted as a pool of biological markers
that vary from changes in biochemicals, nucleic acids and proteins to the
microflora. Saliva has an immense potential as a diagnostic fluid and offers an
edge over other biological fluids as its collection method does not
require invasive procedure, economical and is useful for monitoring systemic
health. Development of sensitive and precise salivary diagnostic tools and the
formulation of defined guidelines following meticulous testing will allow
salivary diagnostics to be utilised as chair side tests for various oral and
systemic diseases in the near future. The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic
is the biggest challenge and global health crisis for the world since World War
Two. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of Covid-19 is crucial in controlling the
outbreak in the community and in hospitals. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal
swabs are the recommended specimen types for Covid-19 diagnostic testing. The
collection of these specimen types requires close contact between healthcare
workers and patients and poses a risk of transmission of the virus, causes
discomfort and may cause bleeding, especially in patients with condition such as 
thrombocytopenia. Hence, nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs are not desirable 
for sequential monitoring of viral load. Saliva specimens can be obtained easily 
as the patient is asked to spit into a sterile bottle. The collection of saliva
is non-invasive and greatly minimizes the exposure of healthcare workers to
Covid-19. Saliva has a high consistency rate of greater than 90% with
nasopharyngeal specimens in the detection of respiratory viruses, including
coronaviruses. Saliva has also been used in screening respiratory viruses among
hospitalized patients without pyrexia or respiratory symptoms. SARS-CoV can be
detected in saliva at high titers. Salivary diagnostics is a dynamic field that
is being incorporated as part of disease diagnosis, clinical monitoring of
systemic health and to make significant clinical decisions for patient care. More
research is required to analyze the potential diagnostic of Covid-19 in saliva to
develop rapid chair side tests for the detection of Covid-19 and it is also
pivotal to improve and develop successful strategies for prevention, especially
for dentists and healthcare professionals who are involved in performing
aerosol-generating procedures.

The outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (Covid-19) imposes a major challenge in
managing patients undergoing surgical operation. In this study, we analyzed
clinical and transmission features of 25 cases of Covid-19 from a single thoracic
department, including 13 patients and 12 health care staff. There were 13 males
and 12 females. The median age of the patients was 61 (range: 51 to 69) years.
The median age of the health care staff was 35 (range: 22 to 51) years. By the
end of follow-up date (Mar. 3, 2020), there were 16 non-severe cases (64%) and 9 
severe cases (36%), 5 cases were dead (20%). Nineteen (76%) of the infected cases
were confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test, the rest were clinically
diagnosed as suspected Covid-19 cases, and 19 (76%) of the infected cases had
positive exposure history. We found that COPD was significantly associated with
severity and death (P=0.040, and P=0.038, respectively), and chest operation was 
significantly associated with death for Covid-19 patients (P=0.039). A potential 
"super spreader" may be the source of the transmission before the implementation 
of quarantine and comprehensive protection. It was concluded that Covid-19 is
associated with poor prognosis for patients undergoing thoracic operation,
especially for those with COPD. Implementation of comprehensive protective
measures is important to control nosocomial infection.

COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease-19) is a zoonotic illness first reported in the
city of Wuhan, China in December 2019, and is now officially a global pandemic as
declared by the World Health Organization. The infection is caused by severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 infected patients
can be asymptomatic carriers or present with mild-to-severe respiratory symptoms.
Imaging, including computed tomography is not recommended to screen/diagnose
COVID-19 infections, but plays an important role in management of these patients,
and to rule out alternative diagnoses or coexistent diseases. In our multicenter 
case series, we outline the clinical presentations and illustrate the most common
imaging manifestations in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

All gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures have a high risk of aerosol
contamination of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to endoscopists, nurses,
and healthcare assistants. Given the current pandemic situation of COVID-19, the 
Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society (JGES) issued the recommendation for 
gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy based on the status of COVID-19 as of April 9th, 
2020, in Japan; 1) indications for GI endoscopy in the pandemic of COVID-19, 2)
practical protective equipment for medical personals depending on the risk for
COVID-19, 3) preprocedural management, such as pharyngeal local anesthesia using 
lidocaine spray which has a potential to generate the aerosols, 4) ideal settings
of the endoscopy room including the numbers of the staff and the patients, 5)
postprocedural management, such as undressing and follow-up of the patients, as
well as the involved staff, were documented to fit the practical scenarios in GI 
endoscopy, with the available data in Japan and the world. We believe that
certain measures will prevent further spread of COVID-19.

The virus severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is
currently affecting more than 200 countries and territories worldwide. It has
been declared as pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) and the whole world 
is suffering from corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, no treatment
for SARS-CoV-2 are approved because of lack of evidence, but a number of clinical
trials are in process and we are expecting fruitful results very soon. This
review focuses on various approaches of treatment and few of the most recent
clinical trials carried out in this field.

Gratitude is positively associated with health and well-being. Past studies of
gratitude have primarily focused on the distinct cultural context of European
Americans. The current studies aimed to extend gratitude research to Latino and
East Asian Americans, 2 collectivistic contexts known to differently value
positive emotions. Two studies explored whether Latino and East Asian Americans
varied in gratitude experience and whether the disposition toward gratitude was
associated with well-being for both. In Study 1, participants completed measures 
of the emotional experience and expression of gratitude. Latino Americans rated
the desirability, appropriateness, frequency, and intensity of their gratitude
experience-expression higher than did East Asian Americans. Moreover, European
Americans' gratitude experience and expression was similar to those of Latino
Americans and higher than those of East Asian Americans. In Study 2, participants
completed measures of gratitude disposition and indicators of well-being. Latino 
Americans reported a higher disposition toward gratitude than did East Asian
Americans. Higher disposition toward gratitude was associated with higher
self-esteem and with less loneliness and perceived stress across groups. However,
the strength of the association of gratitude with subjective health and
depressive symptoms varied by group in theoretically expected ways. The promising
possibilities of extending research on gratitude to culturally diverse groups is 
discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

A Water Quality Index (WQI) is a formulation that enables the estimation of the
overall quality of a water body based on significant parameters. One example of
this is the well-known and widely accepted NSF-WQI, which is frequently used to
assess chemical, physical, and microbiologic features of waterbodies in temperate
latitudes. In this work, a well-structured method, completely based on
multivariate statistical methods and historical data distributions, was used to
develop an ecosystem specific water quality index (ES-WQI). Lake Cajititlán, a
subtropical Mexican lake located in Tlajomulco de Zúñiga, was selected as a case 
of study because it is an endorheic shallow lake that shows signs of high levels 
of eutrophication due to anthropogenic contamination. As a result of the
contamination, and its sensibility to changes in the water level, it undergoes
important changes in its water features, such as turbidity and intense green
color, and experiences massive events of fish mortality. The proposed ES-WQI
describes the changes in water quality over the year well and correlates with the
capability of the lake to support aquatic life, as the lowest estimated values
coincide with the biggest events of massive fish mortality in the lake.
Furthermore, the ES-WQI clearly differentiates between typical cyclic behaviors
and actual deteriorating trends and is capable of tracking incremental changes
all over the range of the possible concentration values of the water quality
parameters.

In the last few weeks Italy first, and then several other countries across the
world, have been swept up by the deadly wave of the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the illness named COVID-19,
from the acronym CO (corona) VI (virus) D (disease) and 19 (year of the virus
identification). The medical community is working day and night to assist
affected people and experts in communicable diseases are striving in multiple
ways to understand the progression of events leading to the lethal respiratory
syndrome.

Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease characterized by lung
damage and involvement in multiple tissues and organs in the whole body. Some of 
the patients may have long-term impairment and dysfunctions, including pulmonary 
fibrosis, heart, liver, kidney, nerve and immune system. Rehabilitation has
certain beneficial effect in the acute stage, and especially in the recovery
stage, including improving respiratory function, exercise endurance, self-care in
daily living activities, as well as psychological support, etc. Rehabilitation is
not offside or absent. A reasonable rehabilitation program needs scientific
research to avoid arbitrary conclusions.

PURPOSE: The aim of our study was to assess CT angiography findings of head and
neck tumours in predicting carotid blow out syndrome (CBS).
METHOD: We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients with head and neck
cancer who underwent invasive angiography for CBS at our Institution from July
2013-2019. All routine CT angiography scans were assessed for the following
findings with a univariate logistic regression analysis: 1) 360 ° involvement of 
the suspect artery by the tumour; 2) tissue or tumour necrosis, which was defined
as an hypodense area with lack of contrast enhancement in the soft tissues of the
neck or tumour mass, adjacent to the suspected vessel; 3) calibre reduction of
the culprit artery; 5) jugular vein infiltration. T stage was also included in
the analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 24 patients who underwent routine CT angiogram neck and
embolization for CBS were included in this study. Univariate logistic regression 
showed as 360 ° involvement of target vessel may significantly increase the risk 
of bleeding (OR 11.6, CI: 1.4-91.5; p = 0.01), along with T stage (OR 14.0, p =
0.03). Tumour necrosis and calibre vessel reduction were quite influential, but
not significantly (i.e. tumour necrosis OR 5.0 95 % CI: 0.8-31.0, p = 0.08).
Contingency table analysis found 360 ° vessel involvement with the highest
sensitivity and PPV in predicting bleeding (87.5 % and 82.35 %, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: CT angiography imaging findings have the potential to identify
patients with head and neck cancer at higher risk of bleeding.

Introduction: A large body of evidence has clearly documented that erectile
dysfunction (ED) represents not only a complication of cardiovascular (CV)
diseases (CVD) but often an early sign of forthcoming CVD.Areas covered: All the 
available data from meta-analyses evaluating the association between ED and CV
risk were collected and discussed. Similarly, all available meta-analyses
investigating the significance of ED as a possible early marker for major adverse
cardiovascular events (MACE) were analyzed. In addition, data originally obtained
in a Florence cohort, dealing with a large series of patients seeking medical
care for sexual dysfunction, will be also reported.Expert opinion: Available
evidence indicates that ED represents a risk factor of CV mortality and
morbidity. Not only conventional CV risk factors but also unconventional ones,
derived from a perturbation of the relational and intrapsychic domains of ED,
might play a possible role in CV risk stratification of ED subjects. Finally,
penile doppler ultrasound can give important information on CV risk, especially
in younger and low risk subjects. The presence of ED should become an opportunity
- for the patient and for the physician - to screen for the presence of
comorbidities improving not only sexual health but, more importantly, men's
overall health.

Introduction: For several years now, medicine has been benefiting from the
contribution of nanoparticles (NPs) technology for both diagnosis and therapy.
They can be used as adjuvants, being capable per se of immune-modulating
activity, or as carriers for molecules to be transported to a specific target,
eventually loaded with specific ligands favoring specific uptake.Areas covered:
The review focuses on experimental use of NPs as adjuvants/carriers for allergen 
immunotherapy (AIT). Human clinical trials conducted so far are discussed.Expert 
opinion: Results of experimental studies and recent clinical trials support the
use of NPs as carrier/adjuvant in AIT. Comparisons between NP-based and classical
AIT are needed, to show the usefulness of the NP-based approach. However, there
are still unsolved problems: the persistence of non-degradable NPs with possible 
toxicological consequences, and the formation of the protein corona around the
NPs, which could alter their activity and fate. Virus-like particles seem the
most promising NPs for allergy treatment, as for other vaccines. Over the next
decade NP-based AIT will be largely used to treat allergic disorders.

Introduction: Patients in intensive care units (ICU) are often develop severe
infections in which are associated with significant mortality rates. A number of 
novel technologies for the rapid microbiological diagnosis of these infections
have been developed, introducing the era of 'fast microbiology'. Treatment of
bacterial and fungal infections in ICU is however complicated by alterations in
the pharmacokinetics of antimicrobial agents.Areas covered: We review novel
pharmacologic tools that can be used to optimize anti-infective therapies and
patient management in ICU. A MEDLINE Pubmed search for articles published from
January 1995 to 2019 was completed matching the terms pharmacokinetics and
pharmacology with antimicrobial agents and ICU or critically-ill patients.
Moreover, additional studies were identified from the reference list of retrieved
articles.Expert opinion: Several tools are in development for the full automation
of the analytical methods used for the quantification of antimicrobial
concentrations within a few hours after sample collection. Ad hoc software with
adaptive feedback is also available for appropriate dose adjustments based on
both individual patient covariate data and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) data
when available. The application of these technological improvements in the
clinical practice should open the way to a "fast pharmacology" at the bedside.

Background: Since early December 2019, the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19)
infection has been prevalent in China and eventually spread to other countries.
There are a few published cases of COVID-19 occurring during pregnancy and due
the possibility of mother-fetal vertical transmission, there is a concern that
the fetuses may be at risk of congenital COVID-19. Methods: We reviewed the risk 
of vertical transmission of COVID-19 to the fetus of infected mothers by using
data of published articles or official websites up to March 4, 2020. Results: A
total of 31 infected pregnant mothers with COVID-19 were reported. No COVID-19
infection was detected in their neonates or placentas. Two mothers died from
COVID-19-related respiratory complications after delivery. Conclusions:
Currently, based on limited data, there is no evidence for intrauterine
transmission of COVID-19 from infected pregnant women to their fetuses. Mothers
may be at increased risk for more severe respiratory complications.

In the last decades, the staggering progress in nanotechnology brought around a
wide and heterogeneous range of nanoparticle-based platforms for the diagnosis
and treatment of many diseases. Most of these systems are designed to be
administered intravenously. This administration route allows the nanoparticles
(NPs) to widely distribute in the body and reach deep organs without invasive
techniques. When these nanovectors encounter the biological environment of
systemic circulation, a dynamic interplay occurs between the circulating proteins
and the NPs, themselves. The set of proteins that bind to the NP surface is
referred to as the protein corona (PC). PC has a critical role in making the
particles easily recognized by the innate immune system, causing their quick
clearance by phagocytic cells located in organs such as the lungs, liver, and
spleen. For the same reason, PC defines the immunogenicity of NPs by priming the 
immune response to them and, ultimately, their immunological toxicity.
Furthermore, the protein corona can cause the physical destabilization and
agglomeration of particles. These problems induced to consider the PC only as a
biological barrier to overcome in order to achieve efficient NP-based targeting. 
This review will discuss the latest advances in the characterization of PC,
development of stealthy NP formulations, as well as the manipulation and
employment of PC as an alternative resource for prolonging NP half-life, as well 
as its use in diagnostic applications.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the neural substrates and
mechanisms that generate memory deficits, seizures and neuropsychiatric
abnormalities in encephalitis with LGI1 antibodies using a data-driven,
multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approach. Methods: Functional MRI
data were acquired from 14 anti-LGI1 encephalitis patients and 14 age and gender 
matched normal controls. Independent component analysis with hierarchical partner
matching (HPM-ICA) was used to assess the whole-brain intrinsic functional
connectivity. Granger causality (GC) was applied to investigate the effective
connectivity among the brain regions that identified by HPM-ICA. Diffusion tensor
imaging (DTI) was utilized to investigate white matter microstructural changes of
the patients. Results: Participants with LGI1 antibodies encephalitis presented
reduced functional connectivity in the brain areas associated with memory,
cognition and motion circuits, while increased functional connectivity in putamen
and caudate in comparison to the normal controls. Moreover, the effective
connectivity in patients was decreased from the frontal cortex to supplementary
motor area. Finally, patients had significant reductions in fractional anisotropy
(FA) for the corpus callosum, internal capsule, corona radiata and superior
longitudinal fasciculus, accompanied by increases in mean diffusivity (MD) for
these regions as compared to controls. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the 
neural disorder and behavioral deficits of anti-LGI1 encephalitis may be
associated with extensive changes in brain connectivity and microstructure. These
pathological alterations affect the basal ganglia and limbic system besides the
temporal and frontal lobe.

The corona pandemic has caused a serious emergency also in the Federal Republic
of Germany; shortages of medical capacities and failure of critical
infrastructures may occur resulting in a pandemic catastrophe. German laws
prescribe various mechanisms for disaster preparedness and disaster response.
Nevertheless, both authorities and physicians will have to make difficult ethical
and legal decisions. In the event of lack of resources (e. g. vaccines or
ventilation capacity), conflict-laden selection decisions must be made. The
regulations on pandemic preparedness need to be reviewed: preparing for the
response to pandemics must be a clear and legally binding task and responsibility
of all state and private agents involved. Here, among other things, planning,
training, exercises and stockpiling are crucial elements of being prepared to
deal with a pandemic.

Publisher: Die Corona-Pandemie löst auch in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland eine
Gefahrenlage aus, deren Auswirkungen – wie z. B. in Italien – zu einem
medizinischen Notstand führen können. Die Überlastung des Gesundheitswesens oder 
anderer kritischer Infrastrukturen können eine Pandemiekatastrophe auslösen. Das 
deutsche Infektionsschutz- und Katastrophenschutzrecht sehen zahlreiche
Mechanismen der Katastrophenvorsorge und der Katastrophenabwehr vor. Dennoch
werden sowohl Behörden als auch Ärzte ethisch und rechtlich schwierige
Entscheidungen treffen müssen. Denn im Falle eines Ressourcenmangels (z. B. von
Impfstoffen oder Beatmungskapazitäten) müssen konfliktträchtige
Auswahlentscheidungen getroffen werden. Einer Überprüfung bedürfen die Regelungen
zur Pandemievorsorge: Die Vorbereitung auf die Pandemiebekämpfung muss eine klare
und rechtsverbindliche Aufgabe aller staatlichen und privaten
Verantwortungsträger darstellen. Hierbei spielen u. a. Planungen, Fortbildungen, 
Übungen und Vorratshaltungen eine zentrale Rolle.

[Deaths in nine regions of Italy in February/March 2020: "Mortality Excess Loupe"
for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19-Epidemiology in Germany].

[Article in German; Abstract available in German from the publisher]

Morfeld P(1), Erren TC(1).

Präventionsforschung, Uniklinik Köln, Köln.

Italy is particularly affected by SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Recently, Colombo and
Impicciatore compared the deaths in 1084 selected municipalities between 21
February 2020 and 21 March 2020 with deaths in the same time period in 2015 to
2019. We extend analyses of data from the Italian National Institute of
Statistics (ISTAT) and calculate SMRs for all causes of death in the nine
selected regions of Italy, separately for men and women and summarized. We
analyze the effect of covariables by Poisson modelling and discuss the
limitations of the current elaborations. We conclude: In agreement with Colombo
and Impicciatore, in the particular corona situation, this "mortality excess
loupe" - assuming otherwise constant determinants of death - can be a
virus-test-independent tool to determine mortality effects of SARS-CoV-2. The
current "loupe" is focused on municipalities with increases of more than 20%
deaths in March 2020 compared to the average deaths on the same days in
2015-2019. The time window of investigation could be opened before 21 February
2020 to detect masked increases in mortality before the first "COVID-19 death"
was ascertained. The current "loupe" conveys pronounced mortality increases also 
in regions that were not considered to be corona hotspots. In this respect, even 
in the absence of representative virus test results, mortality data can be
important indicators of the distribution or spread of a newly acting factor.
Overall, it is advisable to carry out SMR analyses for Germany on a regular
basis, differentiated by region, gender, age group and cause of death. Such
analyses can contribute to the early detection and evaluation of the severity of 
a deadly pandemic ("burden of disease") as well as to monitoring the dynamic
spread of a factor such as SARS-CoV-2. SMR analyses can also be used to assess
and evaluate both desired and undesired effects of measures taken against
SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 - and possibly other epidemics or pandemics.

Publisher: Italien ist besonders durch SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 betroffen. Kürzlich
haben Colombo und Impicciatore die Todesfallzahlen in 1084 ausgewählten Gemeinden
im Zeitfenster 21.2.2020 bis zum 21.3.2020 mit den entsprechenden Todesfallzahlen
in den gleichen Zeitfenstern 2015 bis 2019 verglichen. Wir erweitern Auswertungen
von Daten des Nationalen Instituts für Statistik Italiens (ISTAT) und berechnen
Standardisierte Mortalitäts-Ratios (SMRs) in den neun ausgewählten Regionen
Italiens, getrennt für Männer und Frauen und zusammengefasst. Wir analysieren
Kovariableneinflüsse mit Poisson-Modellen und diskutieren Limitierungen dieser
aktuellen Ausarbeitungen. Wir schlussfolgern: In Übereinstimmung mit Colombo und 
Impicciatore kann in der besonderen Corona-Situation diese
„Mortalitäts-Exzess-Lupe“ – bei Annahme sonst konstanter Determinanten für
Todesfälle – ein Virus-Test-unabhängiges Instrument sein, Mortalitätseffekte von 
SARS-CoV-2 zu bestimmen. Die aktuelle „Lupe“ ist fokussiert auf Gemeinden mit
Zunahmen um mehr als 20% an Todesfällen im März 2020 im Vergleich zu den
durchschnittlichen Todesfällen an denselben Tagen in den Jahren 2015–2019. Man
könnte das Zeitfenster der Untersuchung vor dem 21.2.2020 öffnen, um maskierte
Mortalitätszunahmen bereits vor der ersten Meldung eines „COVID-19-Todesfalls“
festzustellen. Die aktuelle „Lupe“ vermittelt ausgeprägte Mortalitätsanstiege
auch in Regionen, die nicht als Corona-Hotspot galten. Insofern können
Mortalitätsdaten auch bei Fehlen repräsentativer Virus-Testergebnisse wichtige
Hinweise auf die Verteilung oder Ausbreitung eines neu wirkenden Faktors sein. In
der Gesamtschau ist es angezeigt, SMR-Analysen für Deutschland regelmäßig
durchzuführen, differenziert nach Regionen, Geschlechtern, Altersgruppen und
Todesursachen. Solche Analysen können zur Früherkennung und Beurteilung des
Schweregrads einer tödlichen Pandemie („Krankheitslast“) sowie zur Überwachung
der dynamischen Verbreitung eines Faktors wie SARS-CoV-2 beitragen. SMR-Analysen 
können auch genutzt werden, sowohl erwünschte als auch unerwünschte Auswirkungen 
von Maßnahmen gegen SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 – und ggfs. andere Epidemien und
Pandemien – abzuschätzen und zu evaluieren.

The world is confronted by the current pandemic of Corona Virus Disease
(COVID-19), which is a wake-up call for all nations irrespective of their
development status or geographical location. Since the start of the century we
have seen five big infectious outbreaks which proved that epidemics are no more
regarded as historic and geographically confined threats. The Canadian government
underlined that these infectious disease outbreaks are threats to global health
security and disrupt societal wellbeing and development. In this context, the
Public Health Agency of Canada is proactive and has shown its preparedness for
outbreaks of emerging and epidemic-prone diseases, and in dealing with these
pathogens. Even before the declaration of pandemic, Canada has proved its global 
health leadership by ensuring collective action and multisectoral coordination
which still remains a serious challenge especially for low and middle- income
countries with existing poor health systems. In this article we discuss how
Canada is addressing the global challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic through
its leadership and practice of global health diplomacy.

To date, the world perhaps has never waited for the summer so impatiently in the 
entire Anthropocene, owing to the debate whether increasing temperature and
humidity will decrease the environmental endurance of SARS-CoV-2. We present the 
perspective on the seasonal change on SARS-CoV-2 decay and COVID-19 spread. Our
arguments are based on: i) structural similarity of coronavirus with several
enteric viruses, and its vulnerability; ii) reports related to decay of those
similar transmissible gastroenteritis viruses (TGEV) like norovirus and iii)
improvement in the human immunity during summer with respect to winter. We
present reasons why we can be optimistic about the slowdown of corona in the
upcoming summer.

From the medical reports on the flu epidemic in 1918, there is accordance with
the present-day corona pandemic. The symptoms, course and outcome all seem to
show parallels. Pregnant women in the last trimester are to be classified as
being particularly vulnerable. Physicians in several disciplines, e.g.
gynecology, general medicine and internal medicine are equally called upon to be 
particularly vigilant.

INTRODUCTION: COVID-19, is a new corona virus of the Beta Coronavirus genus which
originated in bats. The virus first emerged in China in December 2019 and has
rapidly spread since to other areas worldwide. The World Health Organization
(WHO) has therefore recently declared it as the source of a pandemic. The disease
caused by the virus manifests in most cases as a lower respiratory tract
infection leading to fever, cough and dyspnea, while more severe cases can led to
respiratory failure and/or multi organ failure. COVID-19 enters the human cell
using the ACE2, an enzyme abundant in renal tubular epithelial cells.
Theoretically, this may be significant in several ways: acute kidney injury (AKI)
as well as proteinuria and/or microhematuria could be associated with the
penetration of COVID-19 into the cells. Moreover, medications based on RAAS
inhibition, such and ACE inhibitors and ARBs, upregulate the enzyme ACE2 and
could therefore hypothetically explain the high prevalence of hypertension and
diabetes reported as previous diagnoses in severe cases. In the setting of
chronic kidney disease, the risk of infection with COVID-19 is not clear at this 
time. However, hemodialysis patients represent a unique group of patients, mostly
elderly and immunocompromised, for whom dialysis is a life-saving treatment which
cannot be stopped. Hence, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented a complex medical
and logistic challenge for the medical staff in hospital and community based
dialysis units.

INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic is bringing healthcare systems worldwide to
the brink of collapse. One reason for this is the rapidly increasing number of
new infections. On the other hand, the high sickness rates of doctors and nurses,
particularly in ENT medicine, are aggravating the situation. Telemedicine can be 
a useful tool to reduce the number of physician-patient contacts. This could
break infection chains and minimize the risk of infection for physicians.
METHODS: To prepare the review, a selective literature search was conducted at
www.pubmed.com using the relevant English technical terms for telemedicine and
ENT. In addition, research was conducted at www.news.google.com on current
developments of the COVID-19 pandemic with the search terms "telemedicine" and
"COVID-19."
RESULTS: Telemedicine can be helpful in direct contact with patients as well as
in the conciliar support of general practitioners. The available studies show
that, on average, more than 50% of medical consultations could be carried out
telemedically. Both physicians and patients rate the use of telemedicine
positively. Neither image quality nor the handling of the technology are relevant
obstacles to a reliable diagnosis. Patients indicated that the telemedical
consultation did not last longer than a traditional consultation. Patients also
highlighted the faster and better availability of medical care through
telemedicine.
CONCLUSION: Telemedicine can make a decisive contribution to coping with the
current COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the establishment of telemedicine can
help us to become better prepared for future pandemics.

OBJECTIVE: To study the precision of digital guide plates applied to the implant 
surgery of anterior teeth.
METHODS: Fifty patients scheduled to receive implant restoration treatment in
anterior teeth were enrolled in this study and divided into two groups (n=25,
each group): those who were given routine implant restoration treatment (control 
group, 45 implants) and those who received implant restoration treatment using a 
digital guide plate (test group, 51 implants). After implantation, planned and
placed implants were superimposed using digital software, and deviations (corona,
apex, depth, degree) were analyzed. Esthetic parameters were assessed at 1 week
(baseline), 6 month, and 1 year post final restoration. Pink esthetic (PES) and
white esthetic (WES) scores were respectively used to evaluate the soft tissue
and restoration esthetic outcome.
RESULTS: The deviation parameters in the test group were significantly lower than
those in the control group (P<0.05). PES and WES values recorded for the control 
group at 1 week, 6 month, and 1 year post final restoration were significantly
lower than those in the test group (P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The digital guide plate can improve the accuracy of the
three-dimensional position of implants in the maxillary esthetic zone. As such,
this device may play an important role in obtaining the ideal aesthetic effects
of maxillary anterior teeth.

The outbreak of corona virus disease (COVID-19) has raised concerns among
dentists to develop strategies to prevent infection of dental equipment,
materials, and patients during an epidemic period. Strategies following the
National Laws and Standards of China and local standards of several provinces for
controlling cross-infection and instituting protective measures for medical staff
in dental clinics during an epidemic period are discussed. A proposal is put
forth for dental clinics that will face similar situations in the future. Further
research is warranted to address potential problems that will be encountered
under such dire circumstances.

Safety Guidelines for Sterility of Face Shields During COVID 19 Pandemic.

Khan MM(1), Parab SR(1).

Author information: 
(1)Sushrut ENT Hospital and Dr. Khan's ENT Research Center, Talegaon Dabhade,
India.

Face shields are personal protective equipment devices that are to be used by
many health care workers during COVID 19 pandemic for protection of the facial
area and associated mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth) from droplet spread of
infection. Face shields are generally not used alone, but in conjunction with
other protective equipment like cap, mask, goggle, and are therefore classified
as adjunctive personal protective equipment. In the wake of scarcity of face
shields during the COVID 19 Pandemic, consideration of innovating newer methods
of manufacturing must be considered to overcome the present day scarcity without 
jeopardising the safety of front line Heath care workers. All initial fast
innovations comes with advantages and disadvantages, hence we thought of putting 
down simple guidelines for new emerged face shield use.

A 35-year-old woman presented with fever and mild diarrhoea without any
respiratory symptoms 9 days after travelling to Japan from Wuhan, China. Her
computed tomography scan revealed pneumonia. The first polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) test on throat swab for the novel corona virus upon admission was negative.
Therefore, she was treated for community-acquired pneumonia, but fever persisted.
On hospital day 5, PCR test on induced sputum was positive, but a second
polymerase chain reaction test on throat swab remained negative. She was
discharged, fully recovered, on hospital day 12. A lower respiratory tract
specimen should be obtained for better diagnosis of corona virus disease 2019,
even in the absence of respiratory symptoms for patients with significant travel 
or exposure history.

At the beginning of a COVID-19 infection, there is a period of time known as the 
exposed or latency period, before an infected person is capable of transmitting
the infection to another person. We develop two differential equations models to 
account for this period. The first is a model that incorporates infected persons 
in the exposed class, before transmission is possible. The second is a model that
incorporates a time delay in infected persons, before transmission is possible.
We apply both models to the COVID-19 epidemic in China. We estimate the
epidemiological parameters in the models, such as the transmission rate and the
basic reproductive number, using data of reported cases. We thus evaluate the
role of the exposed or latency period in the dynamics of a COVID-19 epidemic.

BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) associated with human to human
transmission and severe human infection has been recently reported from the city 
of Wuhan in China. Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships 
of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of 
sarbecovirus.
METHODS: Putative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and
discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed 
by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods.
RESULTS: Our analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to
BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows
discordant clustering with the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically,
in the 5'-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3'-part
spanning 24,341-30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster
with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning
the 3'-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV
and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch.
CONCLUSIONS: The levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13
suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the
outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is
very likely. We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is
not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within
the betacoronavirus. These genomic features and their potential association with 
virus characteristics and virulence in humans need further attention.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics 
of Corona Virus Disease 2019 in Taizhou, China.
METHODS: A single center retrospective observational study was performed between 
Jan 1, 2020 and Mar 11, 2020 at Taizhou Public Health Medical Center, Zhejiang,
China. All patients with confirmed Corona Virus Disease 2019 were enrolled, and
their clinical data were gathered by reviewing electronic medical records.
Outcomes of severely ill patients and non-severely ill patients were compared.
RESULTS: Of 145 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the average age was
47.5 years old (standard deviation, 14.6) and 54.5% were men. Hypertension was
the most common comorbidity (15.2%), followed by diabetes mellitus (9.7%). Common
symptoms included dry cough (81.4%), fever (75.2%), anorexia (42.8%), fatigue
(40.7%), chest tightness (32.4%), diarrhea (26.9%) and dizziness (20%). According
to imaging examination, 79.3% patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 18.6% showed
unilateral pneumonia, 61.4% showed ground-glass opacity, and 2.1% showed no
abnormal result. Compared with non-severely ill patients, severely ill patients
were older (mean, years, 52.8 vs. 45.3, p < 0.01), had a higher proportion of
diabetes mellitus (16.3% vs. 6.9%, p = 0.08), had a higher body mass index (mean,
24.78 vs. 23.20, p = 0.02) and were more likely to have fever (90.7% vs. 68.6%,
p = 0.01), anorexia (60.5% vs. 35.3%, p = 0.01), chest tightness (60.5% vs.20.6%,
p < 0.01) and dyspnea (7.0% vs. 0%, p = 0.03). Of the 43 severely ill patients, 6
(14%) received high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy, and 1 (2.3%) received
invasive mechanical ventilation.
CONCLUSIONS: Older patients or patients with comorbidities such as obesity or
diabetes mellitus were more likely to have severe condition. Treatments of
COVID-19 is still experimental and more clinical trials are needed.

The Wuhan outbreak of novel Corona virus infection has been the global focus
since December 2019. This infection has become a global pandemic. It is highly
important to understand the virology of the pathogen and to explore the
therapeutic options for management of this pandemic. Drug repurposing strategies 
are being considered for management of COVID 19. Among the identified drugs,
Baricitinib has become a keen interest for researchers because of its ability to 
inhibit the viral assembly by the prevention of Clarithrin associated
endocytosis. We tried to explore the reasons on why Baricitinib is not an ideal
option for COVID 19.

Despite advances in Drug Discovery, the viral infections always remain the major 
challenge for the Scientists across the globe. The recent pandemic COVID-19 viral
infection has created a disastrous situation all over the world. As no drug is
available to treat such life- threatening disease and the mortality rate is
significantly increased due to COVID-19; there is an utmost need to cure the
infection by Drug Repurposing. Some counties are against the use of these drugs
because of adverse effects associated with drug repurposing and lack of
statistically significant clinical data but they were found to be effective in
some countries to treat affected COVID-19 patients (Off label/ Investigational). 
The article emphases the possible drug candidates in the treatment of COVID-19
infection. Most of these drugs were found to be effective in in vitro studies.
There is a need to reassess the in vitro data and to carry out randomised
clinical trials. Further investigations of these drugs are recommended on the
priority basis.

The outbreak of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a grave global public
health emergency. Nowadays, social media has become the main channel through
which the public can obtain information and express their opinions and feelings. 
This study explored public opinion in the early stages of COVID-19 in China by
analyzing Sina-Weibo (a Twitter-like microblogging system in China) texts in
terms of space, time, and content. Temporal changes within one-hour intervals and
the spatial distribution of COVID-19-related Weibo texts were analyzed. Based on 
the latent Dirichlet allocation model and the random forest algorithm, a topic
extraction and classification model was developed to hierarchically identify
seven COVID-19-relevant topics and 13 sub-topics from Weibo texts. The results
indicate that the number of Weibo texts varied over time for different topics and
sub-topics corresponding with the different developmental stages of the event.
The spatial distribution of COVID-19-relevant Weibo was mainly concentrated in
Wuhan, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and
the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration. There is a synchronization between
frequent daily discussions on Weibo and the trend of the COVID-19 outbreak in the
real world. Public response is very sensitive to the epidemic and significant
social events, especially in urban agglomerations with convenient transportation 
and a large population. The timely dissemination and updating of epidemic-related
information and the popularization of such information by the government can
contribute to stabilizing public sentiments. However, the surge of public demand 
and the hysteresis of social support demonstrated that the allocation of medical 
resources was under enormous pressure in the early stage of the epidemic. It is
suggested that the government should strengthen the response in terms of public
opinion and epidemic prevention and exert control in key epidemic areas, urban
agglomerations, and transboundary areas at the province level. In controlling the
crisis, accurate response countermeasures should be formulated following public
help demands. The findings can help government and emergency agencies to better
understand the public opinion and sentiments towards COVID-19, to accelerate
emergency responses, and to support post-disaster management.

To investigate the effect of villagers' moral obligation and village cadres'
public leadership on villagers' collective action for epidemic prevention and
control, against the background of the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
emergency in China, we constructed models based on the institutional analysis and
development (IAD) framework and employed principal component analysis (PCA) and
ordered probit regression, drawing on survey data from 533 villagers in Henan
province adjacent to the COVID-19 origin province, Hubei, China. The results
indicate that: (1) generally, both moral obligation and public leadership as well
as their constituent indicators contributed positively to collective action for
COVID-19 prevention and control; (2) moreover, moral obligation and public
leadership can strengthen each other's positive role in collective action for
COVID-19 prevention and control. Based on the above findings, this paper suggests
that villagers' moral obligation can be perfected through internalizing epidemic 
prevention and control norms into the villagers' moral norms by the way of
villagers mastering the rural public health governance scheme. In addition,
public leadership can be improved through professional training of village cadres
and by motivating village elites to run for village cadres. With improved
villagers' moral obligation and village cadres' public leadership, collective
action for epidemic prevention and control could be more likely to be realized.

At the end of 2019 a novel virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), causing severe acute respiratory syndrome expanded globally from
Wuhan, China. In March 2020 the World Health Organization declared the SARS-Cov-2
virus a global pandemic. We performed a narrative review to describe existing
literature with regard to Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemiology,
pathophysiology, diagnosis, management and future perspective. MEDLINE, EMBASE
and Scopus databases were searched for relevant articles. Although only when the 
pandemic ends it will be possible to assess the full health, social and economic 
impact of this global disaster, this review represents a picture of the current
state of the art. In particular, we focus on public health impact,
pathophysiology and clinical manifestations, diagnosis, case management,
emergency response and preparedness.

BACKGROUND: Various mechanisms have been postulated to explain how electric
fields emitted by high voltage overhead power lines, and the charged ions they
produce, might be associated with possible adult cancer risk, but this has not
previously been systematically explored in large scale epidemiological research.
METHODS: We investigated risks of adult cancers in relation to modelled air ion
density (per cm3) within 600 m (focusing analysis on mouth, lung, respiratory),
and calculated electric field within 25 m (focusing analysis on non-melanoma
skin), of high voltage overhead power lines in England and Wales, 1974-2008.
RESULTS: With adjustment for age, sex, deprivation and rurality, odds ratios (OR)
in the highest fifth of net air ion density (0.504-1) compared with the lowest
(0-0.1879) ranged from 0.94 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82-1.08] for mouth
cancers to 1.03 (95% CI 0.97-1.09) for respiratory system cancers, with no trends
in risk. The pattern of cancer risk was similar using corona ion estimates from
an alternative model proposed by others. For keratinocyte carcinoma, adjusted OR 
in the highest (1.06-4.11 kV/m) compared with the lowest (<0.70 kV/m) thirds of
electric field strength was 1.23 (95% CI 0.65-2.34), with no trend in risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not provide evidence to support hypotheses that air
ion density or electric fields in the vicinity of power lines are associated with
cancer risk in adults.

OBJECTIVE: Non-hermetically sealed eye protection does not fully protect the eyes
from airborne particles. Hermetically sealed eye protection fully protects the
eyes from particles, but tend to fog up rendering unusable. The purpose of this
study was build and test a filtered eye mask (FEM) to protect the eyes from
airborne particles while being usable without excessive fog build up.
METHODS: The steps performed to build the FEM were described. A
hermetically-sealed standard eye mask (SEM) and a FEM were examined at 1minute,
5minutes and 60minute period for performance metrics relating to fog.
RESULTS: The SEM showed minimal fog at 1-minute, very foggy at 5-minutes and
dripping with condensation at 60minutes. The FEM was clear at 1-minute, 5-minutes
and showed minimal fog at 60minutes.
CONCLUSION: The FEM may play an important role in preventing novel coronavirus
(COVID-19) exposure by protecting the eyes from airborne particles and preventing
fog, rendering it usable. Further research is strongly recommended.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a PEG-corona on oily droplets
of a nanoemulsion on phosphate cleavage on their surface. A PEG-free nanoemulsion
composed of 60% oleic acid, 30% Capmul MCM EP and 10% Span 85 being additionally 
stabilized by 1% cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and 3% phosphatidic acid
(PA) was evaluated regarding phosphate release, zeta potential change and mucus
permeation properties. In order to evaluate the impact of PEG-corona on phosphate
release 10%, 20% and 30% of polyethoxylated-35 castor oil were incorporated in
the nanoemulsion. The developed PEG-free nanoemulsion exhibited the droplet size 
of 123 nm with PDI of 0.24, whereas the droplet size of the nanoemulsions
containing PEG ranged from 166 nm to 128 nm with PDI about 0.26. In case of the
PEG-free formulation enzymatically induced phosphate cleavage was 3-fold and
7-fold higher than that from formulations containing 20% and 30% PEG-surfactant, 
respectively. Accordingly, the zeta potential shift of PEG-free formulation
reached ~Δ 40 mV within 4 h, whereas zeta potential of PEG-containing
formulations did not show any significant changes remaining constant at ~-30 mV. 
In contrast, PEG-containing formulations exhibited a 3.3-fold to 4-fold higher
mucus permeation than the PEG-free formulation. According to the results, a
PEG-corona has a great impact on phosphate cleavage and zeta potential change,
which has to be taken into consideration for the development of highly efficient 
zeta potential changing nanocarriers, as zeta potential constitutes one of the
crucial parameter regarding the permeation properties through physiological
barriers.

Gold nanoparticle (AuNP) interaction with the blood compartment as a function of 
their charge and the binding energy of their surface ligand was explored.
Citrate, polyallylamine and cysteamine stabilized AuNP along with dihydrolipoic
acid and polyethylene glycol capped AuNP were synthesized and fully
characterized. Their interactions with model proteins (human albumin and human
fibrinogen) were studied. Complexes formed between AuNP and protein revealed
several behaviors ranging from corona formation to aggregation. Protein
fluorescence quenching as a function of temperature and AuNP concentration
allowed the determination of the thermodynamic parameters describing these
interactions. The hemolysis induced by AuNP was also probed: an increasing or a
decreasing of hemolysis ratio induced by AuNP was observed as of function of
protein corona formation. Taken together, our results drew up a composite sketch 
of an ideal surface ligand for blood compatible AuNP. This capping agent should
be strongly bound to the gold core by one or more thiol groups and it must confer
a negative charge to the particles.

The musculoskeletal system has an integral role throughout life, including
structural support to the body, protection, and allowing a range of fine to
complex movements for daily living to elite sporting events. At various times,
injuries to the musculoskeletal system occur resulting in varying levels of
impact to the person both acutely and chronically. Specifically, there is a
spectrum of complexity in orthopedic injuries, with some such as common muscle
strains, that while burdensome will have no impact on life-long functional
ability, and others that can result in long lasting disability. Focusing on
extremity injuries, this review highlights: i) the current impact of
orthopedicinjuries in sport and daily life; ii) the foundation of bone and
skeletal muscle repair and regeneration; and iii) the disruptions in regenerative
healing due to traumatic orthopedic injuries. This review seeks to maximize the
broad and collective research impact on sport and traumatic orthopedic injuries
in search of promoting ongoing innovation for treatment and rehabilitation
approaches aimed to improve musculoskeletal health throughout life.

Eosinophils are circulating and tissue-resident leukocytes that have potent
pro-inflammatory effects in a number of diseases. Recently, eosinophils have been
shown to have a variety of other functions, including immunoregulation and
antiviral activity. Eosinophil levels vary dramatically in a number of clinical
settings, especially following eosinophil-targeted therapy, which is now
available to selectively deplete these cells. There are key COVID-19-related
questions concerning eosinophils whose answers affect recommended prevention and 
care. First, do patients with eosinophilia-associated diseases have an altered
course of COVID-19? Second, do patients with eosinopenia (now intentionally
induced by biological drugs) have unique COVID-19 susceptibility and/or disease
course? This is a particularly relevant question as eosinopenia is associated
with acute respiratory deterioration during infection with the Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-Corona Virus (CoV)-2, the causative agent of
COVID-19. Third, do eosinophils contribute to the lung pathology induced during
COVID-19 and will they contribute to immunopotentiation potentially associated
with emerging COVID-19 vaccines? Herein, we address these timely questions and
project considerations during the emerging COVID-19 pandemic.

Hollow nanoparticles such as polymersomes have promising potentials in many
fields. However, the design and construction of higher-order polymersomes with
precisely controlled spatial compartments is still very challenging. Herein, we
report a unique tetrapod polymersome that is assembled by the controlled fusion
of four traditional spherical polymersomes. This original species was prepared
from poly(ethylene
oxide)113-b-poly[4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzyl
methacrylate61-stat-2-(diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate23]
[PEO113-b-P(TBA61-stat-DEA23)] in DMF/water at lower water content (Cw), where
PEO acts as corona forming block. To unravel the secret behind the tetrapod
polymersomes, a series of block copolymers with various comonomer types and
degrees of polymerization were synthesized and self-assembled. PEO113-b-PTBA80
self-assembles into spherical micelles in DMF/water, and the subsequent evolution
into tripod and multipod micelles and finally micelle clusters was achieved by
increasing Cw. This suggests that relatively rigid TBA is a "pro-fusion"
component that facilitates particle-particle fusion due to its providential
hydrophobicity and chain mobility. When one-fourth of TBA of PEO113-b-PTBA80 is
substituted by DEA, spherical polymersomes of PEO113-b-P(TBA61-stat-DEA23) are
born in DMF/water and then fused into dipod, tripod (Cw = 95%), and finally
tetrapod polymersomes (Cw = 100%) upon increasing Cw, suggesting that flexible
DEA is not only a promoter for hollow pods but also an "anti-fusion" component
that can compromise with pro-fusion force for its high chain mobility. The
formation of either tetrapod polymersomes or micelle clusters is a matter of
balance between pro-fusion and anti-fusion forces. Overall, we provide a fresh
insight for the preparation of tetrapod polymersomes as well as other
higher-order structures with precisely defined spatial compartments by
fusion-induced particle assembly (FIPA).

Blood proteins adsorb onto the surface of nanoparticles after intravenous
injection to form a protein corona. The underlying organization and binding
function of these adsorbed proteins remain unclear. This can impact how the
corona mediates cell and tissue interactions. Here, we investigated the function 
and structural organization of the protein corona using an immunoassay approach. 
We discovered that only 27% of the adsorbed proteins examined are functional for 
binding to their target protein. This is because the corona architecture is not a
monolayer, but an assembly of proteins that are bound to each other. We further
demonstrated that we can control the binding functionality of a protein by
changing the organization of proteins in the assembly. We show that manipulation

In soluble methane monooxygenase enzymes (sMMO), dioxygen (O2) is activated at a 
diiron(II) center to form an oxodiiron(IV) intermediate Q that performs the
challenging oxidation of methane to methanol. An analogous mechanism of O2
activation at mono- or dinuclear iron centers is rare in the synthetic chemistry.
Herein, we report a mononuclear non-heme iron(II)-cyclam complex, 1-trans, that
activates O2 to form the corresponding iron(IV)-oxo complex, 2-trans, via a
mechanism reminiscent of the O2 activation process in sMMO. The conversion of
1-trans to 2-trans proceeds via the intermediate formation of an
iron(III)-superoxide species 3, which could be trapped and spectroscopically
characterized at -50 °C. Surprisingly, 3 is a stronger oxygen atom transfer (OAT)
agent than 2-trans; 3 performs OAT to 1-trans or PPh3 to yield 2-trans
quantitatively. Furthermore, 2-trans oxidizes the aromatic C-H bonds of
2,6-di-tert-butylphenol, which, together with the strong OAT ability of 3,
represents new domains of oxoiron(IV) and superoxoiron(III) reactivities.

This article proposes systems for the fair distribution of scarce resources to
healthcare providers. It builds on classic ethical structures and adapts them to 
the equitable distribution of personal protective equipment (PPE) to clinicians
at risk of contracting novel corona virus-19 (COVID-19). The article also defines
systems of allocation that are generally considered unethical and are to be
avoided. We emphasize that policies must be transparent, collaborative, applied
equally, and have a system of accountability. It is recognized that unless the
supply of PPE is quickly replenished, or viable alternatives to traditional
equipment are devised in the coming days to weeks, hospitals and healthcare
systems will face the difficult task of rationing PPE to at-risk clinicians. This
paper suggests an ethical framework for that process.

In contrast to classical ion mobility spectrometers (IMS) operating at ambient
pressure, the high kinetic energy ion mobility spectrometer (HiKE-IMS) is
operated at reduced pressures between 10-40 mbar. In HiKE-IMS, ions are generated
in a reaction region before they are separated in a drift region. Due to the
operation at reduced pressure, it is possible to reach high reduced electric
field strengths up to 120 Td in both the reaction as well as drift region,
resulting in a pronounced decrease in chemical cross sensitivities and a
significant enhancement of the dynamic range. Until now though, only limited
knowledge about the ionization pathways in HiKE-IMS is available. Typically,
proton bound water clusters, H+(H2O)n, are the most abundant positive reactant
ion species in classical IMS with atmospheric chemical ionization sources.
However, at reduced pressure and increased effective ion temperature, the
reactant ion population significantly changes. As the ionization efficiency of
analyte molecules in HiKE-IMS strongly depends on the reactant ion population, a 
detailed knowledge of the reactant ion population generated in HiKE-IMS is
essential. Here, we present a coupling stage of the HiKE-IMS to a mass
spectrometer enabling the identification of ion species and the investigation of 
ion molecule reactions prevailing in HiKE-IMS. In the present study, the
HiKE-IMS-MS is used to identify positive reactant ion populations in both,
purified air and nitrogen, respectively. The experimental data suggest the
generation of systems of clustered primary ions (H+(H2O)n, NO+(H2O)m, and
O2+(H2O)p), which most probably serve as reactant ions. Their relative abundances
highly depend on the reduced electric field strength in the reaction region.
Furthermore, their effective mobilities are studied as a function of the reduced 
electric field strength in the drift region.

The N terminal domain (NTD) of Nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of coronavirus
(CoV) binds to the viral (+) sense RNA and results in CoV ribonucleoprotien (CoV 
RNP) complex, essential for the virus replication. In this study, the RNA-binding
N terminal domain (NTD) of the N protein was targeted for the identification of
possible inhibitors of RNA binding. Two NTD structures of N proteins were
selected (2OFZ and 1SSK, 92% homology) for virtual screening of 56,079 compounds 
from Asinex and Maybridge library to identify top 15 hits for each of the targets
based on "docking score". These top-hits were further screened for MM-GBSA
binding free energy, pharmacokinetic properties (QikProp) and drug-likeness
(SwissADME) and subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) studies. Two suitable
binders (ZINC00003118440 and ZINC0000146942) against the target 2OFZ were
identified. ZINC00003118440 is a theophylline derivative under the drug class
'bronchodilEtors' and further screening with approved bronchodilators was also
studied to identify their ability to bind to the RNA binding region on the N
protein. The other identified top hit is ZINC0000146942, which is a
3,4dihydropyrimidone class molecule. Hence this study suggests two important
class of compounds, theophylline and pyrimidone derivaties as possible inhibitors
of RNA binding to the N terminal domain of N protein of coronavirus, thus opening
new avenues for in vitro validations.

The Public Health Emergency of International Concern declared the widespread
outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 as a global pandemic emergency, which has resulted in
1,773,086 confirmed cases including 111,652 human deaths, as on 13 April 2020, as
reported to World Health Organization. As of now, there are no vaccines or
antiviral drugs declared to be officially useful against the infection.
Saikosaponin is a group of oleanane derivatives reported in Chinese medicinal
plants and are described for their anti-viral, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory,
anticonvulsant, antinephritis and hepatoprotective activities. They have also
been known to have anti-coronaviral property by interfering the early stage of
viral replication including absorption and penetration of the virus. Thus, the
present study was undertaken to screen and evaluate the potency of different
Saikosaponins against different sets of SARS-CoV-2 binding protein via
computational molecular docking simulations. Docking was carried out on a Glide
module of Schrodinger Maestro 2018-1 MM Share Version on NSP15 (PDB ID: 6W01) and
Prefusion 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6VSB) from SARS-CoV-2. From the
binding energy and interaction studies, the Saikosaponins U and V showed the best
affinity towards both the proteins suggesting them to be future research molecule
as they mark the desire interaction with NSP15, which is responsible for
replication of RNA and also with 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein which manage the
connection with ACE2.

The new Corona-virus, recently called the severe acute respiratory syndrome
Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) appears for the first time in China and more precisely
in Wuhan.Natural herbal remedies have long been the main, if not the only, remedy
in the oral tradition for treating illnesses. Modern medicine has known its
success thanks to traditional medicine, the effectiveness of which derives from
medicinal plants.The objective of this study is to determine if the components of
natural origin have an anti-viral effect and which can prevent humans from
infection by this coronavirus using the most reliable method is molecular docking
which used to find an interaction between the molecules studied and the protein, 
in our case we based on the inhibitor Coronavirus (nCoV-2019) spike protein.The
results of molecular docking showed that among 67 molecules of natural origin,
three molecules (Crocin, Digitoxigenin, and β-Eudesmol) which are proposed as
inhibitors against the coronavirus based on the energy of interaction between
these molecules and studied protein.

Recently, the world has witnessed outbreak of a novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2),
the virus which initially emerged in Wuhan, China has now made its way to a large
part of the world, resulting in a public emergency of international concern. The 
functional importance of Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) in viral replication
and maturation turns it into an attractive target for the development of
effective antiviral drugs against SARS and other coronaviruses. At present, there
is no standard drug regime nor any vaccine available against the infection. The
rapid development and identification of efficient interventions against
SARS-CoV-2 remains a major challenge. Based on the available knowledge of closely
related coronavirus and their safety profiles, repurposing of existing antiviral 
drugs and screening of available databases is considered a near term strategic
and economic way to contain the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Herein, we applied
computational drug design methods to identify Chymotrypsin-like protease
inhibitors from FDA approved antiviral drugs and our in-house database of natural
and drug-like compounds of synthetic origin. As a result three FDA approved drugs
(Remdesivir, Saquinavir and Darunavir) and two natural compounds (. flavone and
coumarine derivatives) were identified as promising hits. Further, MD simulation 
and binding free energy calculations were performed to evaluate the dynamic
behavior, stability of protein-ligand contact, and binding affinity of the hit
compounds. Our results indicate that the identified compounds can inhibit the
function of Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) of Coronavirus. Considering the
severity of the spread of coronavirus, the current study is in-line with the
concept of finding the new inhibitors against the vital pathway of the corona
virus to expedite the process of drug discovery.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

BACKGROUND: Since being first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 8, 2019, the 
outbreak of the novel coronavirus, now known as COVID-19, has spread globally.
Some case studies regarding the characteristics and outcome of patients with
COVID-19 have been published recently. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate
the risk factors of COVID-19.
METHODS: Medline, SinoMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched for
clinical and epidemiological studies on confirmed cases of COVID-19.
RESULTS: The incidence of fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea symptoms were 85.6 %
(95CI 81.3-89.9 %), 65.7 % (95CI 60.1-71.4 %), 42.4 % (95CI 32.2-52.6 %) and 21.4
% (95CI 15.3-27.5 %). The prevalence of diabetes was 7.7 % (95CI 6.1-9.3 %),
hypertension was 15.6 % (95CI 12.6-18.6 %), cardiovascular disease was 4.7 %
(95CI 3.1-6.2 %), and malignancy was 1.2 % (95CI 0.5-1.8 %). The complications,
including ARDS risk, ranged from 5.6-13.2 %, with the pooled estimate of ARDS
risk at 9.4 %, ACI at 5.8 % (95CI 0.7-10.8 %), AKI at 2.1 % (95CI 0.6-3.7 %), and
shock at 4.7 % (95CI 0.9-8.6 %). The risks of severity and mortality ranged from 
12.6 to 23.5% and from 2.0 to 4.4 %, with pooled estimates at 18.0 and 3.2 %,
respectively. The percentage of critical cases in diabetes and hypertension was
44.5 % (95CI 27.0-61.9 %) and 41.7 % (95CI 26.4-56.9 %), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Fever is the most common symptom in patients with COVID-19. The most 
prevalent comorbidities are hypertension and diabetes which are associated with
the severity of COVID-19. ARDS and ACI may be the main obstacles for patients to 
treatment recovery. The case severe rate and mortality is lower than that of SARS
and MERS.

In this work we presented a novel computational model of precipitation
polymerization allowing one to obtain core-shell microgels via a realistic
cross-linking process based on the experimental procedure. We showed that the
cross-linker-monomer reactivity ratios r are responsible for the microgel
internal structure. Values of r lower than 1 correspond to the case when
alternating sequences occur at the early reaction stages; this leads to the
formation of microgels with pronounced core-shell structure. The distribution of 
dangling ends for small values of r becomes bimodal with two well-distinguished
peaks, which correspond to the core (short dangling ends) and corona (long
dangling ends) regions. The density profiles confirm the existence of two
distinct regions for small r: a densely cross-linked core and a loose corona
entirely consisting of dangling ends with no cross-linker. The consumption of the
cross-linker in the course in the microgel formation was found to be in a perfect
agreement with the predictions of Monte Carlo (MC) model in the sequence space.

Conjugation of lipid moieties to nucleic-acid therapeutics increases their
interaction with cellular membranes, enhances their uptake and influences in vivo
distribution. Once injected in biological fluids, such modifications trigger the 
binding of various serum proteins, which in turn play a major role in determining
the fate of oligonucleotides. Yet, the role played by each of these proteins,
more than 300 in serum, remains to be elucidated. Albumin, the most abundant
circulating protein is an attractive candidate to study, as it was previously
used to enhance the therapeutic effect of various drugs. Herein, we present a
thorough fluorescent-based methodology to study the effect of strong and specific
albumin-binding on the fate and cellular uptake of DNA oligonucleotides. We
synthesized a library of molecules that exhibit non-covalent binding to albumin, 
with affinities ranging from high (nanomolar) to none. Our results revealed that 
strong albumin binding can be used as a strategy to reduce degradation of
oligonucleotides in physiological conditions caused by enzymes (nucleases), to
reduce uptake and degradation by immune cells (macrophages) and to prevent
non-specific uptake by cells. We believe that introducing protein-binding domains
in oligonucleotides can be used as a strategy to control the fate of
oligonucleotides in physiological environments. While our study focuses on
albumin, we believe that such systematic studies, which elucidate the role of
serum proteins systematically, will ultimately provide a toolbox to engineer the 
next-generation of therapeutic oligonucleotides, overcoming many of the barriers 
encountered by these therapeutics, such as stability, immunogenicity and
off-target effects.

The protein corona significantly changes the nanoparticle (NP) identity both
physicochemically and biologically, and in situ regulation of specific plasma
protein adsorption on NP surfaces has emerged as a promising strategy for
disease-targeting therapy. In the past decade, great progress in protein corona
regulation has been achieved via surface chemistry-based nanomedicine
development. This review first outlines the latest advances in bio-nano
interactions, with special attention to factors that influence the protein
corona, including NP physicochemical properties, the biological environment and
the duration time. Second, NP surface chemistry strategies designed to inhibit
and regulate protein corona formation are highlighted, with special emphasis on
albumin, transferrin, apolipoprotein (apo) E, vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF) and retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4). Finally, the current techniques used
to characterize the protein corona are briefly discussed.

PURPOSE: To systematically review the impact of smoking habits on cardiovascular 
(CV) as well as on male sexual and reproductive function and to provide updated
evidence on the role of electronic cigarettes (e-Cig) on the same topics.
METHODS: A comprehensive Medline, Embase, and Cochrane search was performed
including the following words: smoking, CV system, CV risk, erectile dysfunction 
(ED), and male fertility. Publications from January 1, 1969 up to February 29,
2020 were included.
RESULTS: Smoking has a tremendous negative impact on CV mortality and morbidity. 
Current smoking behavior is also negatively associated with erectile dysfunction 
(ED) and impaired sperm parameters. E-Cig can release significantly lower
concentrations of harmful substances when compared to regular combustible
cigarettes. Whether or not the latter can result in positive CV, sexual, and
fertility outcomes is still under study. Preliminary studies showed that exposure
to e-Cig leads to lower vascular damage when compared to the traditional
cigarette use. However, data on the long-term effects of e-Cig are lacking.
Similarly, preliminary data, obtained in animal models, have suggested a milder
effect of e-Cig on erectile function and sperm parameters.
CONCLUSION: Available evidence showed that e-Cig are much less dangerous when
compared to the traditional tobacco use. However, it should be recognized that
the risk related to e-Cig is still higher when compared to that observed in
non-smoking patients. Hence, e-Cig should be considered as a potential tool, in
the logic of harm reduction, to reduce the CV, sexual and fertility risk in
patients refractory to the fundamental, healthy choice to definitively quit
smoking.

In March 2020, Europe became the epicenter of COVID-19 pandemic. Several
countries organized nationwide population containment, starting on March 9th in
Italy and March 17th in France1 . For the continuity of care and to avoid in
person consultation and disease propagation, the French ministry of health
released incentives to facilitate live interactive consultation for COVID and
non-COVID patients.

Protecting healthcare workers (HCWs) is crucial during Corona Virus Disease 2019 
pandemic and requires wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) [1]. While most
of the studies have focused on the skin reactions caused by gloves, other PPE
such as gowns, respirator masks, face shields and goggles are also worn by HCWs
for long hours during the current epidemic and skin irritations caused by these
equipment may cause discouragement of health workers from using them [2]. In this
letter we have focused on the reaction caused by non-glove PPE.

Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) from contaminated soil accumulates in higher
organisms, and causes health risks to humans. In this research, 71 % of the PFOA 
was degraded, of which 51 % was decomposed into short chain by-products, 19 %
mineralized, and 1 % volatilized with 30 kV of voltage, 50 Hz of discharge
frequency, 1 % of soil moisture, 300 ppm of PFOA concentration and 6.3 of soil pH
using pulsed positive discharge plasma. From a series of experiments, electrons
were identified as the dominant active means of PFOA degradation. The
decomposition by-products were analyzed by LC-MS. The results indicated that PFOA
was decomposed into small by-products including perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), 
perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA), perfluorobutyric
acid (PFBA), pentafluoropropionic acid (PFPrA) and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA).
Moreover, in plasma treated soil, the concentration of ammonia nitrogen increased
from less than 10 ppm-462 ppm, and the average dry weight of lettuce was 1.6 mg
higher than that in natural soil. Additionally, Planctomycetes and Nitrospirae
increased after treatment, indicating that plasma technology promotes the process
of nitrogen cycle. Thus, PFOA polluted soil could be remediated using this pulse 
corona plasma technology, and simultaneously improve the fertility of soil
without chemical injections.

The world is currently dominated by the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic. Besides the obvious concerns about limitation of virus spread and
providing the best possible care to infected patients, a concomitant concern has 
now arisen in view of a putative link between the use of certain drugs, such as
Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) inhibitors and ibuprofen, and an increased risk
for COVID-19 infection. We here discuss this concern in relation to headache
treatment and conclude that, based on current evidence, there is no reason to
abandon treatment of headache patients with RAS inhibitors or ibuprofen.

The study analyzed health care workers' (HCWs) knowledge, practices, and
attitudes regarding COVID-19. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from 4th
February to 8th February 2020 involving a total of 1357 HCWs across 10 hospitals 
in Henan, China. Of those surveyed, 89% of HCWs had sufficient knowledge of
COVID-19, more than 85% feared self-infection with the virus, and 89.7% followed 
correct practices regarding COVID-19. In addition to knowledge level, some risk
factors including work experience and job category influenced HCWs' attitudes and
practice concerning COVID-19. Measures must be taken to protect HCWs from risks
linked to job category, work experience, working hours, educational attainment,
and frontline HCWs.

BACKGROUND: The infectivity and transmission capacity of COVID-2019 cases during 
the incubation period are not very clear. The manuscript described a cluster to
provide information for research on incubation period infection.
METHODS: We collected the required data from "Public Health Emergency Reporting
Management Information System", epidemiological questionnaires for the cases, and
laboratories.
RESULTS: The cluster involved four generations, each of which was transmitted to 
the next generation during the incubation period. The time was 2-7 days, 6-7days,
3-8 days and 9 days prior to onset. As of March 11, the fourth-generation cases
had no symptoms. Combined with the epidemiological data, we inferred that the
source of the cluster was caused by the first-generation, who contacted with more
than ten Wuhan people during the annual meeting from January 15 to 16. Two cases 
in this cluster were tested positive again during isolation and observation after
discharge.
CONCLUSIONS: We determined incubation period was infectious, and confirmed that
it was contagious 9 days before the onset. The patients who were discharged might
need to be observed for a period of time. This study was useful for the practical
work, such as in the investigation of close contacts.

BACKGROUND: Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been announced as a new
coronavirus disease by the World Health Organization. At the time of writing this
article (April 2020), the world is drastically influenced by the COVID-19.
Recently, the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) was published. For
researchers on ID such as ourselves, it is of key interest to learn whether this 
open research dataset may be used to investigate the virus and its consequences
for people with an ID.
METHODS: From CORD-19, we identified full-text articles containing terms related 
to the ID care and applied a text mining technique, specifically the term
frequency-inverse document frequency analysis in combination with K-means
clustering.
RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-nine articles contained one or more of our specified
terms related to ID. We were able to cluster these articles related to ID into
five clusters on different topics, namely: mental health, viral diseases,
diagnoses and treatments, maternal care and paediatrics, and genetics.
CONCLUSION: The CORD-19 open research dataset consists of valuable information
about not only COVID-19 disease but also ID and the relationship between them. We
suggest researchers investigate literature-based discovery approaches on the
CORD-19 and develop a new dataset that addresses the intersection of these two
fields for further research.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of antioxidants (sodium ascorbate - SA,
epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) from Camellia sinensis and punicalagin from
Punica granatum) or lasers (Er:YAG and diode) on bleached dentin.
METHODS: Four hundred and forty slabs of intracoronary dentin were prepared: 224 
for bond strength (debonding test) (n = 14), 96 for chemical analysis (EDS) and
morphology (SEM) (n = 6), 96 for interface analysis (n = 6) and 24 for atomic
force microscopy (AFM). The slabs were distributed according to the
post-treatment after bleaching (35% hydrogen peroxide): GI- no bleaching and no
post-treatment, GII- only bleached, GIII- 10-days delay in restorative procedure,
GIV- 10% SA (10 min), GV- 0.5% EGCG (10 min), GVI- 0.5% punicalagin (10 min),
GVII- Er:YAG laser (0.80W, 20s) and GVIII- diode laser (1.5W, 20s). Restorative
procedures were done. Half of the slabs were analyzed immediately and the others,
after 12 months. Debonding and AFM data were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey tests
(α = 0.05).
RESULTS: All the post-treatments, except for punicalagin, reestablished the
immediate bond strength, similar to those restored after 10 days (p > 0.05).
Following degradation, EGCG and punicalagin reestablished the bond strength
(p < 0.05). Lasers were not effective in maintaining the bond strength after 12
months (p < 0.05). Higher O levels were found after bleaching but were reduced
overtime. Ca and P remained stable. SEM and AFM showed residual granules of SA
and irregular surface due to the laser action. After aging, tags and good
interface were verified in GI, GIII, GV and GVI.
CONCLUSION: Sodium ascorbate, EGCG or lasers restored the immediate bond
strength, but only the natural extracts were effective in the long-term
durability of resin. Thus, EGCG at 0.5% for 10 min seems to be the best
pre-restorative treatment for bleached substrate.

BACKGROUND: The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is taking a toll
on the world's health care infrastructure as well as the social, economic, and
psychological well-being of humanity. Individuals, organizations, and governments
are using social media to communicate with each other on a number of issues
relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Not much is known about the topics being
shared on social media platforms relating to COVID-19. Analyzing such information
can help policy makers and health care organizations assess the needs of their
stakeholders and address them appropriately.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the main topics posted by Twitter users
related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: Leveraging a set of tools (Twitter's search application programming
interface (API), Tweepy Python library, and PostgreSQL database) and using a set 
of predefined search terms ("corona," "2019-nCov," and "COVID-19"), we extracted 
the text and metadata (number of likes and retweets, and user profile information
including the number of followers) of public English language tweets from
February 2, 2020, to March 15, 2020. We analyzed the collected tweets using word 
frequencies of single (unigrams) and double words (bigrams). We leveraged latent 
Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling to identify topics discussed in the
tweets. We also performed sentiment analysis and extracted the mean number of
retweets, likes, and followers for each topic and calculated the interaction rate
per topic.
RESULTS: Out of approximately 2.8 million tweets included, 167,073 unique tweets 
from 160,829 unique users met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis identified 12 
topics, which were grouped into four main themes: origin of the virus; its
sources; its impact on people, countries, and the economy; and ways of mitigating
the risk of infection. The mean sentiment was positive for 10 topics and negative
for 2 topics (deaths caused by COVID-19 and increased racism). The mean for tweet
topics of account followers ranged from 2722 (increased racism) to 13,413
(economic losses). The highest mean of likes for the tweets was 15.4 (economic
loss), while the lowest was 3.94 (travel bans and warnings).
CONCLUSIONS: Public health crisis response activities on the ground and online
are becoming increasingly simultaneous and intertwined. Social media provides an 
opportunity to directly communicate health information to the public. Health
systems should work on building national and international disease detection and 
surveillance systems through monitoring social media. There is also a need for a 
more proactive and agile public health presence on social media to combat the
spread of fake news.

A novel coronavirus pneumonia, first identified in Wuhan City and referred to as 
COVID-19 by the World Health Organization, has been quickly spreading to other
cities and countries. To control the epidemic, the Chinese government mandated a 
quarantine of the Wuhan city on January 23, 2020. To explore the effectiveness of
the quarantine of the Wuhan city against this epidemic, transmission dynamics of 
COVID-19 have been estimated. A well-mixed "susceptible exposed infectious
recovered" (SEIR) compartmental model was employed to describe the dynamics of
the COVID-19 epidemic based on epidemiological characteristics of individuals,
clinical progression of COVID-19, and quarantine intervention measures of the
authority. Considering infected individuals as contagious during the latency
period, the well-mixed SEIR model fitting results based on the assumed contact
rate of latent individuals are within 6-18, which represented the possible impact
of quarantine and isolation interventions on disease infections, whereas other
parameter were suppose as unchanged under the current intervention. The present
study shows that, by reducing the contact rate of latent individuals,
interventions such as quarantine and isolation can effectively reduce the
potential peak number of COVID-19 infections and delay the time of peak
infection.

There has been a global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) since
December 2019. In clinical practice, not only fever and respiratory tract
symptoms but also multiple organ symptoms are observed in patients diagnosed with
COVID-19. Herein, we report a rare case of a patient diagnosed with COVID-19 who 
manifested with concomitant neurological symptoms. The patient developed fever
and respiratory symptoms at disease onset, followed by muscle soreness, and
subsequently altered consciousness and psychiatric symptoms, with positive signs 
based on neurological examination. The patient tested positive for the severe
acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid (throat
swab). Further, chest computed tomography (CT) revealed typical COVID-19
findings, and head CT did not reveal significant abnormalities. The patient
recovered after treatment and was discharged. This rare case indicates that
SARS-CoV-2 can invade the central nervous system, thus causing neurological
symptoms and signs. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate a modification of the classical Burch procedure, called
"Laparoscopic TOT - like Burch colposuspencion". The technique does not involve
any type of prothesis placement and it is an alternative for the patients with
stress urinary incontinence in a future without meshes. Describing and
standardising the procedure in different steps makes the surgery reproducible for
the gynecologists and safe for the patients.
DESIGN: Step-by-step educational video, underlining and focusing on the main
anatomical landmark SETTING: A university tertiary care hospital INTERVENTIONS:
The patient is set under general anaesthesia and in lithotomy position. The
distinct steps of the procedure are performed as followed: Step 1: Installation. 
Two 10 mm trocars are positioned in the midline and two 5 mm trocars - in the
suprapubic region. The recommended intraabdominal pressure is 6-8 mmHg and
excessive Trendelenburg is not needed. Step 2: Entry in the Retzius space. The
median umbilical ligament and the vesicolumbilical fascia are transected. Step 3:
Exposure of the Retzius space and the anatomical structures. The dissection is
continued consecutively towards the pubic bone and the Coopers ligament,
laterally towards the external iliac vessels and corona mortis and medially
towards the bladder neck. Step 4: Vaginal dissection. The pubocervical is
dissected at the level of the pubourethral ligaments. Step 5: Suspension of the
vagina to the Coopers ligament. In contrast to the standard technique, with the
TOT- like Burch the sutures on the pubocervical fascia are placed at the level of
the attachment of the arcus tendinous fascia pelvis and the pubourethral
ligament. This way of suspension ensures a lateral traction on the bladder neck, 
resembling the effect of the transobturator tape (TOT), which leads to lower
incidence of dysuric symptoms. Step 6: Peritoneal closure.
CONCLUSION: The classical colposuspension was created in 1961 for treatment of
stress urinary incontinence prolapse1. In the following years the vaginal meshes 
gained popularity as a treatment option for prolapse and for incontinence due to 
their ease of use and satisfying results, which led to decreased use of the Burch
procedure2,3. In 2019, the FDA forbid the production of the transvaginal meshes
for prolapse4, an interdiction that could influence the use of the synthetic
meshes for incontinence in the future5. Due to these recent events, searching for
an effective way of management for the patients with stress urinary incontinence 
without any synthetic prothesis, the gynecologists turned back to the 60 years
old Burch colposuspension. One of the drawbacks of the original technique is the 
high incidence of voiding difficulties - up to 22%6. Owing to the knowledge of
the exact course of traction with the transoburator tape, in our modified
technique, the lateral direction of the suspension provides a tension- free
support on the urethra and the bladder neck. The laparoscopic TOT - like Burch
colposuspension is a safe and effective treatment for the patients with stress
urinary incontinence, with low rates of dysuric symptoms and represents a
valuable alternative for the gynecologists in a future without meshes.

BACKGROUND: Emergence of the novel corona virus (severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2) in December 2019 has led to the covid-19 pandemic. The
extent of covid-19 involvement in the central nervous system is not well
established, and the presence or the absence of SARS-CoV-2 particles in the
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a topic of debate.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We present two patients with covid-19 and concurrent
neurological symptoms. Our first patient is a 31-year-old man who had flu-like
symptoms due to covid-19 and later developed an acute-onset severe headache and
loss of consciousness and was diagnosed with a Hunt and Hess grade 3 subarachnoid
haemorrhage from a ruptured aneurysm. Our second patient is a 62-year-old woman
who had an ischaemic stroke with massive haemorrhagic conversion requiring a
decompressive hemicraniectomy. Both patients' CSF was repeatedly negative on
real-time PCR analysis despite concurrent neurological disease.
CONCLUSION: Our report shows that patients' CSF may be devoid of viral particles 
even when they test positive for covid-19 on a nasal swab. Whether SARS-CoV-2 is 
present in CSF may depend on the systemic disease severity and the degree of the 
virus' nervous tissue tropism and should be examined in future studies.

The ionization of tartaric acid (TA) in an atmospheric pressure chemical
ionization corona discharge ion source was studied by ion mobility spectrometry
(IMS) with zero air as the drift gas. Density functional theory was used for
structural and thermodynamic analyses of the produced ionic clusters. Ion
mobility spectra of TA were recorded in both positive and negative modes of CD
with and without ammonia and chloroform as dopants in order to produce NH4+ and
Cl-, respectively, as the reactant ions (RIs). In the absence of these dopants,
the RIs were mainly H3O+ and O2- in the positive and negative CD, respectively.
TA solutions in water and methanol were injected into the ionization region of
the IMS instrument, and the product cations TA·H+(H2O)n, TA·H+(CH3OH), TA·NH4+,
and TA·NH4+(CH3OH) were observed in the positive CD. Anionic clusters (TA-H)-,
(TA-H)-·CH3OH, (TA-H)-·TA, TA·Cl-, and (TA)2Cl- were produced in the negative CD.
The anions TA·Cl- and (TA)2Cl- were not produced in an air atmosphere, and we
observed their peaks when pure oxygen was used as the drift gas. Optimized
structures of the clusters showed that TA·NH4+, TA·Cl-, and (TA)2Cl- are small
host-guest systems in the gas phase, with TA as a host. (TA)2Cl- is a weakly
bonded complex (an anion-bound dimer) that was observed at atmospheric pressure. 
The proton-bound dimer TA·H+·TA was not produced in the positive CD, while the
anionic dimer (TA-H)-·TA was observed in the negative CD. This phenomenon was
interpreted on the basis of the hydration of TA·H+ and (TA-H)-.

BACKGROUND: Opportunities and pitfalls of e-health have been described and
assessed in various health domains, but in the field of sexual health, the
respective literature is limited.
AIM: The aim of this document is to present the European Society of Sexual
Medicine's (ESSM) current position statement on e-sexual health.
METHODS: This statement article is an expert opinion-based proposal that was
developed under the auspices of the ESSM with input from the e-sexual health
subcommittee of the ESSM Scientific Committee.
OUTCOMES: ESSM statements were provided on four domains: health information for
patients, e-learning for professionals, health interventions, and health
research.
RESULTS: e-Sexual health is the use of information and communication technologies
for sexual health including sexual health care, surveillance, education,
knowledge, and research. Quality indicators have to be applied on Web pages that 
provide sexual health information, e-learning can increase educational
opportunities for professionals, online treatment interventions can be effective 
but needs to be available to the public, and online health research can provide
access to difficult to reach populations.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The ESSM acknowledges the necessity for the use of
information and communication technologies to meet the sexual health needs of
citizens and patients and also the professional needs of sexual healthcare
providers, in an evidence-based manner.
STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: ESSM statements on this topic were provided based on
expert opinion and summarize the ESSM position in this field.
CONCLUSION: The ESSM believes that e-sexual health can provide opportunities for 
the improvement of the sexual health of the population. Kirana PS, Gudeloglu A,

Corona virus pandemic has affected all the 50 states in the USA. States such as
NY, CA and WA being the most affected. According to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) website, as of 28 March 2020, the total number of
cases in the USA is over 103 300 and number of deaths to 1668. In the coming
weeks, COVID-19 rates are expected to begin skyrocketing and hit a peak in late
April/May/June given lessons learned from China, Italy and others. COVID-19 has
been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) as confirmed
cases approach 575 444 patients with 26 654 deaths across over 160 countries, as 
of 28 March 2020. There is a lot of impact on management of the urgent and
emergent cases. This article highlights the changes that are being made in
delivering urgent and emergent surgical care during the pandemic.

BACKGROUND: Since the first case of a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
infection pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, China, a series of confirmed cases of 
the COVID-19 were found in Southwest China. The aim of this study was to describe
the imaging manifestations of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19
infection in southwest China.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, data were collected from 131 patients with 
confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from 3 Chinese hospitals. Their
common clinical manifestations, as well as characteristics and evolvement
features of chest CT images, were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 100 (76%) patients had a history of close contact with people
living in Wuhan, Hubei. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 included cough,
fever. Most of the lesions identified in chest CT images were multiple lesions of
bilateral lungs, lesions were more localized in the peripheral lung, 109 (83%)
patients had more than two lobes involved, 20 (15%) patients presented with
patchy ground glass opacities, patchy ground glass opacities and consolidation of
lesions co-existing in 61 (47%) cases. Complications such as pleural thickening, 
hydrothorax, pericardial effusion, and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes were
detected but only in rare cases. For the follow-up chest CT examinations (91
cases), We found 66 (73%) cases changed very quickly, with an average of
3.5 days, 25 cases (27%) presented absorbed lesions, progression was observed in 
41 cases (46%), 25 (27%) cases showed no significant changes.
CONCLUSION: Chest CT plays an important role in diagnosing COVID-19. The imaging 
pattern of multifocal peripheral ground glass or mixed consolidation is highly
suspicious of COVID-19, that can quickly change over a short period of time.

Importance: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) emerged in China and has spread globally,
creating a pandemic. Information about the clinical characteristics of infected
patients who require intensive care is limited.
Objective: To characterize patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
requiring treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU) in the Lombardy region of
Italy.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective case series of 1591 consecutive 
patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 referred for ICU admission to the
coordinator center (Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico,
Milan, Italy) of the COVID-19 Lombardy ICU Network and treated at one of the ICUs
of the 72 hospitals in this network between February 20 and March 18, 2020. Date 
of final follow-up was March 25, 2020.
Exposures: SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real-time reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal
swabs.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Demographic and clinical data were collected,
including data on clinical management, respiratory failure, and patient
mortality. Data were recorded by the coordinator center on an electronic
worksheet during telephone calls by the staff of the COVID-19 Lombardy ICU
Network.
Results: Of the 1591 patients included in the study, the median (IQR) age was 63 
(56-70) years and 1304 (82%) were male. Of the 1043 patients with available data,
709 (68%) had at least 1 comorbidity and 509 (49%) had hypertension. Among 1300
patients with available respiratory support data, 1287 (99% [95% CI, 98%-99%])
needed respiratory support, including 1150 (88% [95% CI, 87%-90%]) who received
mechanical ventilation and 137 (11% [95% CI, 9%-12%]) who received noninvasive
ventilation. The median positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was 14 (IQR,
12-16) cm H2O, and Fio2 was greater than 50% in 89% of patients. The median
Pao2/Fio2 was 160 (IQR, 114-220). The median PEEP level was not different between
younger patients (n = 503 aged ≤63 years) and older patients (n = 514 aged ≥64
years) (14 [IQR, 12-15] vs 14 [IQR, 12-16] cm H2O, respectively; median
difference, 0 [95% CI, 0-0]; P = .94). Median Fio2 was lower in younger patients:
60% (IQR, 50%-80%) vs 70% (IQR, 50%-80%) (median difference, -10% [95% CI, -14%
to 6%]; P = .006), and median Pao2/Fio2 was higher in younger patients: 163.5
(IQR, 120-230) vs 156 (IQR, 110-205) (median difference, 7 [95% CI, -8 to 22];
P = .02). Patients with hypertension (n = 509) were older than those without
hypertension (n = 526) (median [IQR] age, 66 years [60-72] vs 62 years [54-68];
P < .001) and had lower Pao2/Fio2 (median [IQR], 146 [105-214] vs 173 [120-222]; 
median difference, -27 [95% CI, -42 to -12]; P = .005). Among the 1581 patients
with ICU disposition data available as of March 25, 2020, 920 patients (58% [95% 
CI, 56%-61%]) were still in the ICU, 256 (16% [95% CI, 14%-18%]) were discharged 
from the ICU, and 405 (26% [95% CI, 23%-28%]) had died in the ICU. Older patients
(n = 786; age ≥64 years) had higher mortality than younger patients (n = 795; age
≤63 years) (36% vs 15%; difference, 21% [95% CI, 17%-26%]; P < .001).
Conclusions and Relevance: In this case series of critically ill patients with
laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to ICUs in Lombardy, Italy, the majority
were older men, a large proportion required mechanical ventilation and high
levels of PEEP, and ICU mortality was 26%.

The definite diagnosis of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is based on the
viral isolation or positive result of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from
sputum, or nasal swab, or throat swab. However, the sensitivity to detect
COVID-19 of real time (RT)-PCR is reported to be lower than that of chest CT. We 
report a case of 34-year-old man who was diagnosed as negative for COVID-19 based
on the four sequential RT-PCR tests of his pharyngeal swab. Chest CT showed
patchy ground-glass opacity on admission, and it rapidly progressed to segmental 
mixed consolidation and ground-glass opacity 3 days after admission, and it
resolved in left upper lobe, but showed multifocal ground-glass opacities 7 days 
after admission, and they resolved within 2 weeks. The fifth RT-PCR test finally 
revealed positive results at the fifth day after admission. It is difficult to
distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from other viral pneumonia on CT findings alone;
however, we emphasize the utility of chest CT to detect early change of COVID-19 
in cases which RT-PCR tests show negative results.

PURPOSE: With the COVID-19 crisis, recommendations for personal protective
equipment (PPE) are necessary for protection in orthopaedics and traumatology.
The primary purpose of this study is to review and present current evidence and
recommendations for personal protective equipment and safety recommendations for 
orthopaedic surgeons and trauma surgeons.
METHODS: A systematic review of the available literature was performed using the 
keyword terms "COVID-19", "Coronavirus", "surgeon", "health-care workers",
"protection", "masks", "gloves", "gowns", "helmets", and "aerosol" in several
combinations. The following databases were assessed: Pubmed, Cochrane Reviews,
Google Scholar. Due to the paucity of available data, it was decided to present
it in a narrative manner. In addition, participating doctors were asked to
provide their guidelines for PPE in their countries (Austria, Luxembourg,
Switzerland, Germany, UK) for consideration in the presented practice
recommendations.
RESULTS: World Health Organization guidance for respiratory aerosol-generating
procedures (AGPs) such as intubation in a COVID19 environment was clear and
included the use of an FFP3 (filtering face piece level 3) mask and face
protection. However, the recommendation for surgical AGPs, such as the use of
high-speed power tools in the operating theatre, was not clear until the UK
Public Health England (PHE) guidance of 27 March 2020. This guidance included
FFP3 masks and face protection, which UK surgeons quickly adopted. The
recommended PPE for orthopaedic surgeons, working in a COVID19 environment,
should consist of level 4 surgical gowns, face shields or goggles, double gloves,
FFP2-3 or N95-99 respirator masks. An alternative to the mask, face shield and
goggles is a powered air-purifying respirator, particularly if the surgeons fail 
the mask fit test or are required to undertake a long procedure. However, there
is a high cost and limited availabilty of these devices at present. Currently
available surgical helmets and toga systems may not be the solution due to a
permeable top for air intake. During the current COVID-19 crisis, it appeared
that telemedicine can be considered as an electronic personal protective
equipment by reducing the number of physical contacts and risk contamination.
CONCLUSION: Orthopaedic and trauma surgery using power tools, pulsatile lavage
and electrocautery are surgical aerosol-generating procedures and all body fluids
contain virus particles. Raising awareness of these issues will help avoid
occupational transmission of COVID-19 to the surgical team by aerosolization of
blood or other body fluids and hence adequate PPE should be available and used
during orthopaedic surgery. In addition, efforts have to be made to improve the
current evidence in this regard.

Drug-loaded polymer micelles or nanoparticles are being continuously explored in 
the fields of drug delivery and nanomedicine. Commonly, a simple core-shell
structure is assumed, in which the core incorporates the drug and the corona
provides steric shielding, colloidal stability, and prevents protein adsorption. 
Recently, the interactions of the dissolved drug with the micellar corona have
received increasing attention. Here, using small-angle neutron scattering, we
provide an in-depth study of the differences in polymer micelle morphology of a
small selection of structurally closely related polymer micelles at different
loadings with the model compound curcumin. This work supports a previous study
using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and we confirm that the
drug resides predominantly in the core of the micelle at low drug loading. As the
drug loading increases, neutron scattering data suggests that an inner shell is
formed, which we interpret as the corona also starting to incorporate the drug,
whereas the outer shell mainly contains water and the polymer. The presented data
clearly shows that a better understanding of the inner morphology and the impact 
of the hydrophilic block can be important parameters for improved drug loading in
polymer micelles as well as provide insights into the structure-property
relationship.

The interactions between natural colloidal organic matter and actinides in
solutions are complex and not fully understood. In this work, a crew-cut
polystyrene-b-poly(acry1ic acid) (PS-b-PAA) micelle is proposed as a model
particle for humic acid (HA) colloid with the aim to better understand the
sequestration, aggregation, and mobility of HA colloids in the presence of uranyl
ions. The effects of uranyl ions on the structure of PS29k-b-PAA5k micelles in
aqueous solution were mainly investigated by synchrotron small-angle X-ray
scattering. A core-shell model, accounting for the thickness and contrast changes
of the PAA corona induced by the adsorption of uranyl, was employed to analyze
the scattering data. A combination of transmission electron microscopy, dynamic
light scattering, and zetametry showed a strong affinity of uranyl ions to PAA
segments in water at pH 4-5 that resulted in the shrinkage and improved contrast 
of the PAA corona, as well as colloidal destabilization at a high uranyl
concentration.

AIMS: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, better known as
COVID-19 has become the current health concern to the entire world. Initially
appeared in Wuhan, China around December 2019, it had spread to almost 187
countries due to its high contagious nature. Precautionary measures remain the
sole obliging tactic to cease the person to person transmissions till any
effective method of treatment or vaccine is developed. Amidst the pandemic,
research and development of new molecule is labour-intensive and tedious process.
Drug repurposing is the concept of identifying therapeutically potent molecule
from the library of pre-existing molecules.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, 61 molecules that are already being 
used in clinics or under clinical scrutiny as antiviral agents are surveyed via
docking study. Docking study was performed using Maestro interface (Schrödinger
Suite, LLC, NY).
KEY FINDINGS: Out of these 61 molecules, 37 molecules were found to interact with
>2 protein structures of COVID-19. The docking results indicate that amongst the 
reported molecules, HIV protease inhibitors and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
inhibitors showed promising features of binding to COVID-19 enzyme. Along with
these, Methisazone an inhibitor of protein synthesis, CGP42112A an angiotensin
AT2 receptor agonist and ABT450 an inhibitor of the non-structural protein 3-4A
might become convenient treatment option as well against COVID-19.
SIGNIFICANCE: The drug repurposing approach provide an insight about the
therapeutics that might be helpful in treating corona virus disease.

The Effect of Ligand Mobility on the Cellular Interaction of Multivalent
Nanoparticles.

Multivalent nanoparticle binding to cells can be of picomolar avidity making such
interactions almost as intense as those seen with antibodies. However, reducing
nanoparticle design exclusively to avidity optimization by the choice of ligand
and its surface density does not sufficiently account for controlling and
understanding cell-particle interactions. Cell uptake, for example, is of
paramount significance for a plethora of biomedical applications and does not
exclusively depend on the intensity of multivalency. In this study, it is shown
that the mobility of ligands tethered to particle surfaces has a substantial
impact on particle fate upon binding. Nanoparticles carrying angiotensin-II
tethered to highly mobile 5 kDa long poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains separated
by ligand-free 2 kDa short PEG chains show a superior accumulation in
angiotensin-II receptor type 1 positive cells. In contrast, when ligand mobility 
is constrained by densely packing the nanoparticle surface with 5 kDa PEG chains 
only, cell uptake decreases by 50%. Remarkably, irrespective of ligand mobility
and density both particle types have similar EC50 values in the 1-3 × 10-9 m
range. These findings demonstrate that ligand mobility on the nanoparticle corona
is an indispensable attribute to be considered in particle design to achieve
optimal cell uptake via multivalent interactions.

were identified beginning with the discovery of SARS-CoV in 2002. With the recent
detection of SARS-CoV-2, there are now seven human coronaviruses. Those that
cause mild diseases are the 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1, and the pathogenic species
are SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Coronaviruses (order Nidovirales, family
Coronaviridae, and subfamily Orthocoronavirinae) are spherical (125nm diameter), 
and enveloped with club-shaped spikes on the surface giving the appearance of a
solar corona. Within the helically symmetrical nucleocapsid is the large positive
sense, single stranded RNA. Of the four coronavirus genera (α,β,γ,δ), human
coronaviruses (HCoVs) are classified under α-CoV (HCoV-229E and NL63) and β-CoV
(MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoVOC43 and HCoV-HKU1). SARS-CoV-2 is a β-CoV and shows
fairly close relatedness with two bat-derived CoV-like coronaviruses,
bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Even so, its genome is similar to that of the
typical CoVs. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats, and it appears to be so
for SARS-CoV-2 as well. The possibility of an intermediate host facilitating the 
emergence of the virus in humans has already been shown with civet cats acting as
intermediate hosts for SARS-CoVs, and dromedary camels for MERS-CoV.
Human-to-human transmission is primarily achieved through close contact of
respiratory droplets, direct contact with the infected individuals, or by contact
with contaminated objects and surfaces. The coronaviral genome contains four
major structural proteins: the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and the
nucleocapsid (N) protein, all of which are encoded within the 3' end of the
genome. The S protein mediates attachment of the virus to the host cell surface
receptors resulting in fusion and subsequent viral entry. The M protein is the
most abundant protein and defines the shape of the viral envelope. The E protein 
is the smallest of the major structural proteins and participates in viral
assembly and budding. The N protein is the only one that binds to the RNA genome 
and is also involved in viral assembly and budding. Replication of coronaviruses 
begin with attachment and entry. Attachment of the virus to the host cell is
initiated by interactions between the S protein and its specific receptor.
Following receptor binding, the virus enters host cell cytosol via cleavage of S 
protein by a protease enzyme, followed by fusion of the viral and cellular
membranes. The next step is the translation of the replicase gene from the virion
genomic RNA and then translation and assembly of the viral replicase complexes.
Following replication and subgenomic RNA synthesis, encapsidation occurs
resulting in the formation of the mature virus. Following assembly, virions are
transported to the cell surface in vesicles and released by exocytosis.

This paper provides an overview of the current global market and manufacturing
landscape for hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). The capacity and capabilities of global
producers to meet the potential demand for treating patients inflicted with
COVID-19 by the novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2, should HCQ's efficacy be
established by more definitive clinical trials, is also assessed. Given the large
existing manufacturing base and abundance of raw materials for HCQ, the supply
challenge can be met with considerable efforts and international cooperation.
Preemptive and coordinated emergency efforts among global governments, regulatory
agencies, chemical and pharmaceutical industries are imperative for meeting the
surge in demand.

RATIONALE: Pusher syndrome is a disorder of postural control. It is associated
with unilateral lesions on central vestibular system. In the current study, we
attempted to identify and investigate neural connectivity of the parieto-insular 
vestibular cortex in a patient with pusher syndrome, using diffusion tensor
imaging.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 60-year-old male patient had left hemiplegia due to an
infarction on right premotor cortex, primary motor cortex, corona radiata and
temporal and occipital lobe. The patient had severe motor weakness in left upper 
and lower limb, left side neglect and significant pusher syndrome.
DIAGNOSIS: Patient was diagnosed with left hemiplegia due to an infarction in the
right middle cerebral artery territory at the neurology department of a
university hospital.
INTERVENTIONS: One patient and 5 control subjects of similar age participated.
Diffusion tensor imaging data were acquired at 4-month and 12-month after the
initial injury.
OUTCOMES: Fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and tract volume (TV) were
measured. TV values in both affected and unaffected hemispheres of the patient
were significantly decreased at 4-month compared to those of control subjects. In
the unaffected hemisphere of the patient, TV value showed significant increase at
12-month compared to that at 4-month. Although the TV value at 12-month of the
affected hemisphere was out of reference range, TV was considerably increased
compared to that at 4-month. Mean values for fractional anisotropy or mean
diffusivity in 2 hemispheres did not show significant difference compared to
those of control subjects regardless of month.
LESSONS: Restoration of an injured projection pathway between the vestibular
nuclei and parieto-insular vestibular cortex with recovery of pusher syndrome was
found in a patient with stroke.

BACKGROUND: Dietary lignans belong to the group of phytoestrogens together with
coumestans, stilbenes and isoflavones, and themselves do not exhibit
oestrogen-like properties. Nonetheless, the gut microbiota converts them into
enterolignans, which show chemical similarity to the human oestrogen molecule.
One of the richest dietary sources of lignans are oilseeds, including flaxseed.
The aim of this pilot study was to determine the concentration of the main
dietary lignans in an oilseed mix, and explore the gut microbiota-dependent
production of enterolignans for oestrogen substitution in young and premenopausal
women. The oilseed mix was fermented in a pH-controlled batch culture system
inoculated with women's faecal samples. The lignan content and enterolignan
production were measured by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem
mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS), and the faecal-derived microbial communities
were profiled by 16S rRNA gene-based next-generation sequencing.
RESULTS: In vitro batch culture fermentation of faecal samples inoculated with
oilseed mix for 24 h resulted in a substantial increase in enterolactone
production in younger women and an increase in enterodiol in the premenopausal
group. As for the gut microbiota, different baseline profiles were observed as
well as different temporal dynamics, mainly related to Clostridiaceae, and
Klebsiella and Collinsella spp.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the small sample size, our pilot study revealed that
lignan-rich oilseeds could strongly influence the faecal microbiota of both
younger and premenopausal females, leading to a different enterolignan profile
being produced. Further studies in larger cohorts are needed to evaluate the
long-term effects of lignan-rich diets on the gut microbiota and find out how
enterolactone-producing bacterial species could be increased. Diets rich in
lignans could potentially serve as a safe supplement of oestrogen analogues to
meet the cellular needs of endogenous oestrogen and deliver numerous health
benefits, provided that the premenopausal woman microbiota is capable of
converting dietary precursors into enterolignans.

advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus
(2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia (standard version)" as a featured article in
Military Medical Research. In the guideline, except for "confirmed cases",
"suspected cases", "close contact" and "suspicious exposure" were defined by
clinical perspective based on epidemiological risk, clinical symptoms and
auxiliary examination. Combined with our experience, we introduced a simple
scoring proposal additionally based on not only CT imaging as strongly
recommended by the guideline but also blood routine test, especially for primary 
screening of such patients in the out-patient department.

INTRODUCTION: Prostate specific antigen and Prostate specific antigen-density are
used for the initial evaluation of patient with LUTS due to benign prostatic
enlargement in order to discriminate between benign conditions and prostate
cancer. Conversely, the role of these markers during the follow up of benign
prostatic enlargement patients is still unclear. The aim of our study is to
evaluate the role of prostate specific antigen and prostate specific antigen
density as outcome parameter for both medical and surgical treatment in patients 
with male LUTS.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis based on
data from clinical trials evaluating the clinical effect of medical or surgical
therapy on LUTS/benign prostatic enlargement. Meta-regression analyses were done 
to evaluate the effects of several factors on IPSS score improvement.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We selected 12 studies out of 433, including data on 1959
patients. Both medical and surgical treatment lead to a significant reduction of 
PSA levels as compared to baseline (P<0.001). However, after medical treatment,
lower PSA values are associated with more significant improvements in lower
urinary tract symptoms as measured with the IPSS, while after surgery (P<0.05),
the recovery of urinary function does not correlate with the decline in PSA
values (P=0.59). After medical treatment, the improvement in LUTS correlate with 
a decline of PSAD, while the opposite holds true in men treated with surgery
(both: P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: PSAD may represent an objective treatment outcome parameter and
should be evaluated during the follow up of men treated for LUTS due to BPE as
marker of treatment response.

To the Editor We read with interest the excellent article of Licari et al. 
reporting that anxiety and depression are common in adolescents suffering from
asthma as well as in their parents, mainly in mothers. The consequence of this
relationship is that emotional disorders might negatively affect also the control
of asthma.

With each passing day, more cases of Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) are being
detected and unfortunately the fear of novel corona virus 2019 (2019-nCoV)
becoming a pandemic disease has come true. Constant efforts at individual,
national, and international level are being made in order to understand the
genomics, hosts, modes of transmission and epidemiological link of nCoV-2019. As 
of now, whole genome sequence of the newly discovered coronavirus has already
been decoded. Genomic characterization nCoV-2019 have shown close homology with
bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses,
bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Structural analysis of the receptor binding
site has confirmed that 2019-nCoV binds with the same ACE 2 receptor protein as
human SARS virus. Compared to the previous coronavirus outbreaks, the overall
mortality rate is relatively low for COVID-2019 (2-3%). Suspected cases must be
quarantined till their test comes positive or they clear infection. At present,
treatment of COVID-2019 is mostly based on the knowledge gained from the SARS and
MERS outbreaks. Remdesivir, originally develop as a treatment for Ebola virus
disease and Marburg virus infections, is being studied for it effectiveness
against 2019-nCoV infection. Many other antiviral agents and vaccines are being
tested but most of them are in phase I or II and hence unlikely to be of any
benefit immediately with regards to current outbreak. Hence, the standard
infection control techniques and preventive steps for healthy individuals and
supportive care for the confirmed cases is the best available strategy to deal
with current viral outbreak. .

The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in reorganization 
of healthcare settings affecting the delivery of clinical care to patients with
spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). There is a concern that patients with SMA may be
at increased risk of manifesting severe symptoms of COVID-19. Currently approved 
therapies for SMA improve survival and motor function, however, their delivery
requires an increased exposure to the health system and a dedicated healthcare
team. In this paper, we discuss consensus recommendations pertaining to care of
SMA patients during the pandemic. We highlight that SMA treatments should not be 
perceived as elective. Decisions regarding the delay of treatments should be made
with consideration of the potential risks of COVID-19 exposure and the risk of
that delay. We emphasize the importance of collaborative treatment decisions
between the patient, family, and health care provider, considering any geographic
or institution-specific policies and precautions for COVID-19. This article is

The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in the
reorganization of healthcare settings affecting clinical care delivery to
patients with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DBMD) as well as other
inherited muscular dystrophies. The magnitude of the impact of this public health
emergency on the care of patients with DBMD is unclear as they are suspected of
having an increased risk for severe manifestations of COVID-19. In this paper,
the authors discuss their consensus recommendations pertaining to care of these
patients during the pandemic. We address issues surrounding corticosteroid and
exon skipping treatments, cardiac medications, hydroxychloroquine use,
emergency/respiratory care, rehabilitation management, and the conduct of
clinical trials. We highlight the importance of collaborative treatment decisions
between the patient, family, and health care provider, considering any geographic
or institution-specific policies and precautions for COVID-19. We advocate for
continuing multidisciplinary care for these patients using telehealth. This

Revision total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) is increasing of relevance in orthopaedic
surgeon daily practice and this trend is likely to continue in the years ahead.
The aim of this systematic review of English literature is to summarize and
compare indications, complications, clinical and radiological results of
metaphyseal cones and sleeves in management of bone loss in rTKA. Retrospective
or prospective studies with at least 1 year of follow-up (FU) were included. The 
PRISMA 2009 flowchart and checklist were considered to edit the review. Clinical 
and radiological results, rates of intraoperative fractures, aseptic loosening,
periprosthetic joint infection, septic failure, reoperations and re-revisions
were extrapolated by the papers. Thirty-seven articles were included in the
systematic review. Results of 927 cones (mean FU of 3.6 ± 1.4 years) and 1801
sleeves (mean FU of 4.5 ± 1.6 years) were analysed. The studies showed good
clinical and functional outcomes. Cones and sleeves allowed a stable metaphyseal 
fixation. The aseptic survivorship of the implants was 97.3% in cones group and
97.8% in sleeves group. Metaphyseal cones and sleeves represent a viable option
in management of type IIb and III AORI bone defects in aseptic and septic TKAr
with overlapping survival rate. Further high-quality long-term studies would
better clarify complications, clinical and radiological results of these
promising techniques in revision total knee arthroplasty.

There has been a lot of speculation that patients with coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) who are receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or
angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may be at increased risk for adverse
outcomes. We reviewed the available evidence, and have not found this to be the
case. We recommend that patients on such medications should continue on them
unless there is a clinical indication to stop their use.

Breast cancer is the abnormal, uncontrollable proliferation of cells in the
breast. Conventional treatment modalities like chemotherapy induce deteriorating 
side effects on healthy cells. Non-viral inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) confer
exclusive characteristics, such as, stability, controllable shape and size,
facile surface modification, and unique magnetic and optical properties which
make them attractive drug carriers. Among them, carbonate apatite (CA) particles 
are pH-responsive in nature, enabling rapid intracellular drug release, but are
typically heterogeneous with the tendency to self-aggregate. Here, we modified
the nano-carrier by partially substituting Ca2+ with Mg2+ and Fe3+ into a basic
lattice structure of CA, forming Fe/Mg-carbonate apatite (Fe/Mg-CA) NPs with the 
ability to mitigate self-aggregation, form unique protein corona in the presence 
of serum and efficiently deliver doxorubicin (DOX), an anti-cancer drug into
breast cancer cells. Two formulations of Fe/Mg-CA NPs were generated by adding
different concentrations of Fe3+ and Mg2+ along with a fixed amount of Ca2+ in
bicarbonate buffered DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium), followed by 30
min incubation at 37 °C. Particles were characterized by turbidity analysis,
z-average diameter and zeta potential measurement, optical microscopy, field
emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), flame atomic absorption
spectroscopy (FAAS), pH dissolution, drug binding, cellular uptake, thiazolyl
blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, stability analysis, and protein corona
study by LCMS (Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry). Both formulations of
Fe/Mg-CA displayed mostly uniform nano-sized particles with less tendency to
aggregate. The EDX and FAAS elemental analysis confirmed the weight (%) of Ca, Fe
and Mg, along with their Ca/P ratio in the particles. A constant drug binding
efficiency was noticed with 5 μM to 10 μM of initial DOX concentration. A pH
dissolution study of Fe/Mg-CA NPs revealed the quick release of DOX in acidic pH.
Enhancement of cytotoxicity for the chemotherapy drug was greater for Fe/Mg-CA
NPs as compared to CA NPs, which could be explained by an increase in cellular
internalization as a result of the small z-average diameter of the former. The
protein corona study by LCMS demonstrated that Fe/Mg-CA NPs exhibited the highest
affinity towards transport proteins without binding with opsonins.
Biodistribution study was performed to study the effect of DOX-loaded Fe/Mg-CA
NPs on the tissue distribution of DOX in Balb/c 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. Both
formulations of Fe/Mg-CA NPs have significantly increased the accumulation of DOX
in tumors. Interestingly, high Fe/Mg-CA NPs exhibited less off-target
distribution compared to low Fe/Mg-CA NPs. Furthermore, the blood plasma analysis
revealed prolonged blood circulation half-life of DOX-loaded low and high
Fe/Mg-CA NPs compared to free DOX solution. Modifying CA NPs with Fe3+ and Mg2+, 
thereby, led to the generation of nano-sized particles with less tendency to
aggregate, enhancing the drug binding efficiency, cellular uptake, and
cytotoxicity without hampering drug release in acidic pH, while improving the
circulation half-life and tumor accumulation of DOX. Therefore, Fe/Mg-CA which
predominantly forms a transport protein-related protein corona could be a
proficient carrier for therapeutic delivery in breast cancer.

In spite of radical advances in nanobiotechnology, the clinical translation of
nanoparticle (NP)-based agents is still a major challenge due to various
physiological factors that influence their interactions with biological systems. 
Recent decade witnessed meticulous investigation on protein corona (PC) that is
the first surrounds NPs once administered into the body. Formation of PC around
NP surface exhibits resilient effects on their circulation, distribution,
therapeutic activity, toxicity and other factors. Although enormous literature is
available on the role of PC in altering pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
NPs, understanding on its analytical characterization methods still remains
shallow. Therefore, the current review summarizes the impact of PC on biological 
fate of NPs and stressing on analytical methods employed for studying the NP-PC.

Doublecortin like kinase 1 (DCLK1) is an understudied kinase that is upregulated 
in a wide range of cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
However, little is known about its potential as a therapeutic target. We used
chemoproteomic profiling and structure-based design to develop a selective, in
vivo-compatible chemical probe of the DCLK1 kinase domain, DCLK1-IN-1. We
demonstrate activity of DCLK1-IN-1 against clinically relevant patient-derived
PDAC organoid models and use a combination of RNA-sequencing, proteomics and
phosphoproteomics analysis to reveal that DCLK1 inhibition modulates proteins and
pathways associated with cell motility in this context. DCLK1-IN-1 will serve as 
a versatile tool to investigate DCLK1 biology and establish its role in cancer.

Receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) regulates cell death and
inflammatory responses downstream of TNFR1 and other receptors, and has been
implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and degenerative diseases. RIPK1
kinase activity induces apoptosis and necroptosis, however the mechanisms and
phosphorylation events regulating RIPK1-dependent cell death signaling remain
poorly understood. Here we show that RIPK1 autophosphorylation at serine 166
plays a critical role for the activation of RIPK1 kinase-dependent apoptosis and 
necroptosis. Moreover, we show that S166 phosphorylation is required for RIPK1
kinase-dependent pathogenesis of inflammatory pathologies in vivo in four
relevant mouse models. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that trans
autophosphorylation at S166 modulates RIPK1 kinase activation but is not by
itself sufficient to induce cell death. These results show that S166
autophosphorylation licenses RIPK1 kinase activity to induce downstream cell
death signaling and inflammation, suggesting that S166 phosphorylation can serve 
as a reliable biomarker for RIPK1 kinase-dependent pathologies.

Visible-light and infrared-light persistent phosphors are extensively studied and
are being used as self-sustained glowing tags in darkness. In contrast,
persistent phosphors for higher-energy, solar-blind ultraviolet-C wavelengths
(200-280 nm) are lacking. Also, persistent tags working in bright environments
are not available. Here we report five types of Pr3+-doped silicates (melilite,
cyclosilicate, silicate garnet, oxyorthosilicate, and orthosilicate)
ultraviolet-C persistent phosphors that can act as self-sustained glowing tags in
bright environments. These ultraviolet-C persistent phosphors can be effectively 
charged by a standard 254 nm lamp and emit intense, long-lasting afterglow at
265-270 nm, which can be clearly monitored and imaged by a corona camera in
daylight and room light. Besides thermal-stimulation, in bright environments,
photo-stimulation also contributes to the afterglow emission and its contribution
can be dominant when ambient light is strong. This study expands persistent
luminescence research to the ultraviolet-C wavelengths and brings persistent
luminescence applications to light.

The functional consequences of somatic non-coding mutations in ovarian cancer
(OC) are unknown. To identify regulatory elements (RE) and genes perturbed by
acquired non-coding variants, here we establish epigenomic and transcriptomic
landscapes of primary OCs using H3K27ac ChIP-seq and RNA-seq, and then integrate 
these with whole genome sequencing data from 232 OCs. We identify 25 frequently
mutated regulatory elements, including an enhancer at 6p22.1 which associates
with differential expression of ZSCAN16 (P = 6.6 × 10-4) and ZSCAN12 (P = 0.02). 
CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of this enhancer induces downregulation of both genes.
Globally, there is an enrichment of single nucleotide variants in active binding 
sites for TEAD4 (P = 6 × 10-11) and its binding partner PAX8 (P = 2×10-10), a
known lineage-specific transcription factor in OC. In addition, the collection of
cis REs associated with PAX8 comprise the most frequently mutated set of
enhancers in OC (P = 0.003). These data indicate that non-coding somatic
mutations disrupt the PAX8 transcriptional network during OC development.

PURPOSE: To investigate the correlation between the diffusion tensor imaging
(DTI) measures and the reading, spelling, writing, rapid naming, memory, and
motor abilities in Arabic dyslexic children. This could verify the influence of
possible white matter alterations on the abilities of those children.
METHODS: Twenty native Arabic-speaking children with dyslexia (15 males and 5
females; 8.2 years ± 1) underwent DTI of the brain on 1.5 T scanner.
Diffusion-weighted images were acquired in 32 noncollinear direction.
Tractography of the arcuate fasciculus (AF) was performed. Region of interest
(ROI)-based approach was also used. Regions encompass superior longitudinal
fasciculus (SLF), anterior and superior corona radiata (CR), and posterior limb
of internal capsule (PLIC) were analyzed. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent
diffusion coefficient (ADC) were measured. The aptitudes of those children were
evaluated by the dyslexia assessment test. These abilities were statistically
correlated with the FA and ADC of the AF and other ROIs.
RESULTS: The reduction of FA of right AF was related to worse overall reading and
related abilities performance. The ADC of right SLF was negatively correlated
with memory abilities. The ADC of right PLIC was positively correlated with
writing performance. Other relations were also found.
CONCLUSION: White matter microstructural DTI measurements in the right AF, right 
PLIC, SLF, and left anterior and superior CR are correlated to reading, spelling,
writing, memory, and rapid naming abilities of the participants. The DTI measures
could be promising regarding their use as a biomarker for follow-up in
developmental dyslexia.

Functional hemispherectomy/hemispherotomy is a disconnection procedure for severe
medically refractory epilepsy where the seizure foci diffusely localize to one
hemisphere. It is an improvement on anatomical hemispherectomy and was first
performed by Rasmussen in 1974. Less invasive surgical approaches and refinements
have been made to improve seizure freedom and minimize surgical morbidity and
complications. Key anatomical structures that are disconnected include the 1)
internal capsule and corona radiata, 2) mesial temporal structures, 3) insula, 4)
corpus callosum, 5) parietooccipital connection, and 6) frontobasal connection. A
stepwise approach is indicated to ensure adequate disconnection and prevent
seizure persistence or recurrence. In young pediatric patients, careful patient
selection and modern surgical techniques have resulted in > 80% seizure freedom
and very good functional outcome. In this report, the authors summarize the
history of hemispherectomy and its development and present a graphical guide for 
this anatomically challenging procedure. The use of the osteoplastic flap to
improve outcome and the management of hydrocephalus are discussed.

Corona virus disease 2019 SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a zoonotic virus causing a
variety of severe of respiratory diseases. SARS-CoV-2 is closest to SARS-CoV and 
MERS-CoV in structure. The highly prevalence of COVID-19 is due to the lack onset
of symptoms. Our study aimed to present an overview of the virus in terms of
structure, epidemiology, symptoms, treatment, and prevention. Conduct the
differences of whole genome sequence and some viral proteins to determine the gap
and the change alternation of nucleotides and amino acids sequences. We evaluate 
11 complete genome sequence of different coronavirus using BAST and MAFFT
software. We also selected 7 types of structural proteins. We were conclude that 
COVID-19 might be created new mutations specifically in glycoproteins hence
requires caution and complete preparation by health authorities.

SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a new virus causing respiratory illness outbreak.
Nowadays, COVID-19 has spread to several countries around the world and is
presently a major global concern. It appears that no certain effective
pharmaceutical agent is currently available for it. It seems that obesity is one 
of the biggest risk factors related to COVID-19 hospitalization and critical
illness. The strengthening of the body systems by non-drug ways is very important
especially in obese people. On the basis of some indirect evidence, it seems that
moderate physical activity can be recommended as a non-pharmacological,
inexpensive, and viable way to cope with corona. On the other hand, recommending 
higher intensity exercise needs further consideration to make final decision in
this regard.

Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) secrete high levels of transforming growth
factor-β1 (TGF-β1) that contributes to the development of pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC). TGF-β1 modulates the expression of L1 cell adhesion
molecule (L1CAM), but its role in tumour progression still remains controversial.
To clarify L1 function in PDAC and cellular phenotypes, we performed L1CAM cell
sorting, silencing and overexpression in several primary pancreatic cancer cells.
PSCs silenced for TGF-β1 were used for crosstalk experiments. We found that
TGF-β1 secreted by PSCs negatively regulates L1CAM expression, through canonical 
TGF-β-Smad2/3 signalling, leading to a more aggressive PDAC phenotype. Cells with
reduced expression of L1CAM harboured enhanced stemness potential and
tumourigenicity. Inactivation of TGF-β1 signalling in PSCs strongly reduced the
aggressiveness of PDAC cells. Our data provide functional proof and mechanistic
insights for the tumour-suppressive function of L1CAM via reducing stemness.
Rescuing L1CAM expression in cancer cells through targeting of TGF-β1 reverses
stemness and bears the potential to improve the still miserable prognosis of PDAC
patients.

Human saliva is an inquisitively complex fluid and has an imperative role for
prevention and protection from viral infection, particularly through innate
immune system, which is a prominent first-line defense against viral infection
(Malamud et al., 2011; Dawes et al., 2015). Despite the clear role of saliva in
the continuous cleansing of oral cavity, we focus on proteins that illustrate
antiviral activity, particularly against corona viruses.

plate insertion in treatment of the anterior pelvic ring fracture by studying the
relationship between the vessel and the position of plate.
METHOD: The corona mortis was dissected out of eight adult cadavers and were
simulated for the insertion of the anterior ring minimally invasive plate, and
the presence of the anastomotic branch (the corona mortis) in the suprapubic
branch area was observed. After the Corona mortis stripped off, the data was
measured, such as the length, vessel diameter, distance from the pubic tubercle, 
and the maximum vertical distance between the corona mortis and the pubis. The
measured data and the previous literatures were analyzed to study the morphology 
of the corona mortis and the position relation between the corona mortis and the 
placement of subperiosteal tunnel through the minimally invasive ilioinguinal
approach.
RESULTS: Out of the 16 unilateral pelvises, the corona mortis were observed on 12
unilateral pelvises with an incidence rate of 75%. Amongst them, there were seven
cases of vein anastomosis (incidence of 43.75%), three cases of arterial
anastomosis (incidence of 18.75%), and two cases of both arterial anastomosis and
vein anastomosis (incidence of 12.5%). The corona mortis length ranged between
24.5 and 37.5 mm (average of 30.7 ± 3.6 mm); the diameter ranged between 1.6 and 
3.5 mm (average of 2.5 ± 0.5 mm) and the distance between the vessels and the
pubic tubercle was between 53.9 and 65.2 mm (average of 59.0 ± 3.6 mm). Above the
pubis, the corona mortis originated from the iliac or the inferior epigastric
vessel. It crossed the pubic branch to the dorsal side of the pubis and proceeded
downward to anastomize with the obturator vessels near the obturator. Toothless
tweezers were used to peel and lift up the corona mortis from the pubic bone. The
maximum vertical distance between the corona mortis and the pubis ranged between 
8.8 and 18.3 mm (average of 12.6 ± 3.0 mm).
CONCLUSION: The corona mortis have a high rate of incidence, with a large number 
of differences in the type and shape of blood vessels among patients. Following
peeling, the movement between the corona mortis and pubic bone is limited.
Nevertheless, the plate and bone exfoliator still passed safely. Therefore, when 
surgeons use the minimally invasive ilioinguinal approach to establish channels, 
the process of subperiosteal stripping must be performed to avoid any accidental 
injury.

[Diagnostic consideration and bedside estimation of the prognosis in COVID-19
patients].

In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown origin occured in
Wuhan, China. The identified infective agent is a novel corona virus called
“severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2) and the
respiratory disease caused by this agent aquired the name “coronavirus disease
2019” (COVID-19). In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the
novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. We reviewed the international literature
regarding the novel coronavirus outbreak. Here below, we focus mainly on the
diagnostic issues of COVID-19 and on the estimation of the prognosis. We detail
the relevant anamnestic factors and initial examination results which serve as
basics for the clinical suspicion of COVID-19. We also focus on the proper method
of microbiological sampling and the relevant informations regarding diagnostic
tests like the gold standard real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. We also cite the current national epidemiologic
regulations of testing for novel coronavirus. In the last section, we emphasize
the importance and the potential way of early identification of high-risk
patients. The COVID-19 pandemic may cause substantial epidemiological and
healthcare burden even in Hungary. In addition to the epidemiologic interventions
aiming the deceleration of the outbreak, the early identification and the correct
hospital treatment remain key issues since these may influence mortality. The
chances of the critically ill patients could be improved solely by a high-quality
and careful critical care. It is prudent to meet the experiences of colleagues
working hard with these patients in the already heavily infected countries. Orv
Hetil. 2020; 161(17): 667–671.

Publisher: 2019 decemberében új koronavírus okozta járvány ütötte fel a fejét a
kínai Wuhanban. Az azonosított kórokozó egy új koronavírus, melyet „severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2”-nek, azaz SARS-CoV-2-nek neveztek el, az
általa kiváltott légzési tünetegyüttes pedig a „coronavirus disease 2019”, azaz
COVID–19 nevet kapta. Az Egészségügyi Világszervezet (WHO) a járványt 2020
márciusában pandémiává minősítette. Áttekintettük a jelenleg elérhető nemzetközi 
irodalmat a COVID–19-járvány vonatkozásában. Írásunkban az új koronavírus
diagnosztikájára és prognosztikájára vonatkozó releváns információkat
összegezzük. Részletezzük a klinikai gyanú felvetéséhez szükséges anamnesztikus
tényezőket és kezdeti vizsgálati eredményeket, a mikrobiológiai mintavétel
módját, a molekuláris diagnosztikai tesztre – az arany standardnak minősülő
’real-time’ reverztranszkriptáz polimeráz-láncreakcióra (RT-PCR) – vonatkozó
alapvető információkat, különös tekintettel a diagnosztikus tesztelést érintő,
jelenleg érvényben lévő népegészségügyi szabályozásra. Hangsúlyt fektetünk
továbbá a nagy rizikójú betegek paramétereire és felismerésük módjára. A
COVID–19-pandémia Magyarországon is jelentős járványügyi és egészségügyi
következményekkel járhat. A járvány lassítására irányuló epidemiológiai
intézkedéseken túl a már fertőzött személyek időbeli felismerése és megfelelő
kórházi ellátása mortalitási szempontból is kulcskérdés. A kritikus állapotú
betegek esélyeit csak magas minőségű, körültekintő intenzív terápiás ellátással
lehet javítani, s hogy a legjobbat tudjuk nyújtani, hasznos, ha felhasználjuk a
már endémiás országokban dolgozó orvoskollégák tapasztalatait. Orv Hetil. 2020;

Introduction: There is a lack of data on the use and effectiveness of
pre-hospital pelvic circumferential compression devices (PCCD) as a temporary
intervention for pelvic fracture management; they are thought to decrease pelvic 
volume and hemorrhage but are not without risks. The purpose of this study is to 
examine pre-hospital PCCD practices at US Level I trauma centers.
Methods: This was a prospective cross-sectional survey of trauma medical
directors at US Level I trauma centers. The aim of this study was to describe
patterns of pre-hospital PCCD utilization for pelvic fractures. Responses were
compared by region, length in time the center was designated Level I, trauma
patient volume, pelvic management guideline followed and blood product
guidelines. Data were compared using Fisher's exact and chi-squared tests.
Results: Of the 158 Level I trauma centers invited, 25% responded. All Level I
trauma centers use in-hospital PCCDs, whereas 71% of participant's paramedic
agencies trained on pre-hospital PCCD application. Of those, 44% trained to apply
pre-hospital PCCDs to all suspected pelvic fractures. A higher proportion of
high-volume centers (77%) than low-volume centers (25%) trained on pre-hospital
PCCD placement, p = 0.06. PCCD practices were not dependent on the trauma
center's region, trauma volume, length in time as a Level I trauma center, or
pelvic fracture guideline followed.
Conclusions: There is widespread application of in-hospital and pre-hospital PCCD
at US Level I trauma centers, however pre-hospital PCCDs are not applied to all
suspected pelvic fractures. Future studies should focus on efficacy, safety, and 
contraindications for pre-hospital PCCDs.

Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) primed with paclitaxel (PTX) are now
hypothesized to represent a potential Trojan horse to vehicle and deliver PTX
into tumors. We analyzed the anticancer activity of PTX released by ADSCs primed 
with PTX (PTX-ADSCs) (~20 ng/mL) in a panel of ovarian cancer (OvCa) cells
sensitive or resistant to PTX. We used two (2D) and three dimensional (3D) in
vitro models (multicellular tumor spheroids, MCTSs, and heterospheroids) to mimic
tumor growth in ascites. The coculture of OvCa cells with PTX-ADSCs inhibited
cell viability in 2D models and in 3D heterospheroids (SKOV3-MCTSs plus
PTX-ADSCs) and counteracted PTX-resistance in Kuramochi cells. The cytotoxic
effects of free PTX and of equivalent amounts of PTX secreted in
PTX-ADSC-conditioned medium (CM) were compared. PTX-ADSC-CM decreased OvCa cell
proliferation, was more active than free PTX and counteracted PTX-resistance in
Kuramochi cells (6.0-fold decrease in the IC50 values). Cells cultivated as 3D
aggregated MCTSs were more resistant to PTX than 2D cultivation. PTX-ADSC-CM
(equivalent-PTX) was more active than PTX in MCTSs and counteracted
PTX-resistance in all cell lines. PTX-ADSC-CM also inhibited OvCa-MCTS
dissemination on collagen-coated wells. In conclusion, PTX-ADSCs and PTX-MSCs-CM 
may represent a new option with which to overcome PTX-resistance in OvCa.

As the number of cases of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) rise in the United States (US),
the number of severe cases (those requiring ICU admission) rise with it.
Initially, the estimate for severe cases was approximated at 5% based on
experience from China.1, 2 However, the World Health Organization's (WHO)
estimate from China for severe and critical cases is near 20% (Table).3 The
primary clinical feature of COVID-19 is pneumonia, the severity of which directs 
the clinical course; it has been estimated that, of patients admitted to the ICU,
up to half may require either invasive or non-invasive ventilatory support.4 This
has created an unprecedented situation for emergency and critical care medicine.

We use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to study the behavior of
polymer-tethered particles immersed in fluids of isotropic particles. Particles
modified with weakly anchored, mobile ligands are considered. We discuss how the 
concentration of fluid particles affects the morphology of an isolated hairy
particle. It is shown that hairy particles present different morphologies
including typical core-shell, octopus-like and corn-like, depending on
fluid-segment interactions and the fluid density. The mechanism of changes in the
shape of hairy particles is explained. The reconfiguration of the polymer corona 
arises from adsorption of fluid particles "on chains". The adsorbed fluid
particles form bridges between the chains. This causes the mobile ligands to
merge into clusters on the core surface. A part of the core remains empty so the 
hairy particle becomes a Janus-like object. We also study co-assembly in mixtures
of hairy and isotropic particles. Depending on the strength of fluid-segment
interactions, hairy particles with fluid particles trapped inside their coronas
remain isolated or form mixed clusters of different structures. The aggregation
of hairy particles results from the formation of bridges between chains belonging
to different cores by fluid particles.

Theories beyond the standard model often predict the existence of an additional
neutral boson, the Z^{'}. Using data collected by the Belle II experiment during 
2018 at the SuperKEKB collider, we perform the first searches for the invisible
decay of a Z^{'} in the process e^{+}e^{-}→μ^{+}μ^{-}Z^{'} and of a
lepton-flavor-violating Z^{'} in e^{+}e^{-}→e^{±}μ^{∓}Z^{'}. We do not find any
excess of events and set 90% credibility level upper limits on the cross sections
of these processes. We translate the former, in the framework of an L_{μ}-L_{τ}
theory, into upper limits on the Z^{'} coupling constant at the level of
5×10^{-2}-1 for M_{Z^{'}}≤6  GeV/c^{2}.

Several corona viral infections have created serious threats in the last couple
of decades claiming the death of thousands of human beings. Recently, corona
viral epidemic raised the issue of developing effective antiviral agents at the
earliest to prevent further losses. Natural products have always played a crucial
role in drug development process against various diseases, which resulted in
screening of such agents to combat emergent mutants of corona virus. This review 
focuses on those natural compounds that showed promising results against corona
viruses. Although inhibition of viral replication is often considered as a
general mechanism for antiviral activity of most of the natural products, studies
have shown that some natural products can interact with key viral proteins that
are associated with virulence. In this context, some of the natural products have
antiviral activity in the nanomolar concentration (e.g., lycorine,
homoharringtonine, silvestrol, ouabain, tylophorine, and 7-methoxycryptopleurine)
and could be leads for further drug development on their own or as a template for
drug design. In addition, a good number of natural products with anti-corona
virus activity are the major constituents of some common dietary supplements,
which can be exploited to improve the immunity of the general population in
certain epidemics.

Facial Aging: A 54-Year, Three-Dimensional Population Study.

Lambros V(1).

Author information: 
(1)Corona del Mar, Calif. From private practice.

BACKGROUND: There is no accurate visual representation of the aging process, one 
that visually shows how the shape of the face changes with age in a rigorous and 
three-dimensional way.
METHOD: A total of 594 subjects were studied. Two hundred eighty
three-dimensional images of male faces and 305 three-dimensional images of female
faces were categorized into "young" and "old" groups by sex. The mean age of the 
younger men was 33.6, and the mean age of the older men was 70.3. The mean age of
the younger women was 24, and the mean age of the older women was 74. Landmarks
were placed on all images, and in the male groups the distances between these
landmarks were analyzed with an independent t test to compare the differences
between age groups. These measurements were then used to develop validated
three-dimensional averaged models of the different groups. These averages were
formed into comparative image transitions and studied.
RESULTS: The comparative image transitions of the average young and old faces in 
this series show accurate and registered age and shape changes. The faces of men 
and women age in almost identical ways. The images imply that the aging process
is not solely along the surface planes of the face but at right angles to it,
that is, many of the changes are in and out, not up and down. Males and females
seem to age in quantitatively similar ways.
CONCLUSIONS: These images are unique in the facial aging literature. The main
points and conclusions of this article are derived from and only visible in the
comparative image transitions included in this article as supplemental digital
content. The reader is encouraged to study them because the side-by-side still
images do not show the changes.

To date, insect scale robots capable of controlled flight have used
flapping-wings for generating lift, but this requires a complex and failure-prone
mechanism. A simpler alternative is electrohydrodynamic (EHD) thrust, which
requires no moving mechanical parts. In EHD, corona discharge generates a flow of
ions in an electric field between two electrodes; the high-velocity ions transfer
their kinetic energy to neutral air molecules through collisions, accelerating
the gas and creating thrust. We introduce a fabrication process for EHD thruster 
based on 355 nm laser micromachining, which potentially allows for greater
materials selection, such as fiber-based composites, than is possible with
semiconductor-based lithographic processing. Our four-thruster device measures
1.8 × 2.5 cm and is composed of steel emitters and a lightweight carbon fiber
mesh. We measured the electrical current and thrust of each thruster of our
four-thruster design, showing agreement with the Townsend relation. The peak
thrust of our device, at 5.2 kV, was measured to be 3.03 times its 37 mg (363.0
μN) mass using a precision balance. In free flight, we demonstrated liftoff at
4.6 kV.

According to the Situation Report 65 of the World Health Organization of March
25, 2020, the COVID-19 incidence rate indicates 413 467 confirmed cases and 18
433 deaths. Genetic diversification of the Corona virus has resulted in strains
that cause severe respiratory tract infections in humans via drip and animal
mediation. S-proteins covering its surface, which bind to the cell receptor -
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) and transmembrane serine protease
(TMPRSS2) are important in shaping virus activity. The course of infection varies
from mild to severe. The ability to control infection is limited because there
are no drugs that fully inhibit 2019-nCoV. Interferon-alpha (5 million U twice
daily by inhalation), lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily orally), as
well as chloroquine (500 mg twice daily orally for 10 days) and azithromycin (500
mg twice per day) cause a milder course of the disease and reduce the duration of
treatment. The administration of glucocorticosteroids and research drugs
(tocilizumab) is acceptable for massive infiltrative lesions in the pulmonary
parenchyma causing severe lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS). In the system operation it is necessary to create the socalled a
safety matrix that would take into account the existing threat on the one hand
and all available services and resources on the other. Precise analysis and
separation of individual tasks can enable the creation of a real crisis
management plan.

Even though the global COVID-19 pandemic may affect how medical care is delivered
in general, most countries try to maintain steady access for women to routine
pregnancy care, including fetal anomaly screening. This means that, also during
this pandemic, fetal anomalies will be detected, and that discussions regarding
invasive genetic testing and possibly fetal therapy will need to take place. For 
patients, concerns about Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus 2 will
add to the anxiety caused by the diagnosis of a serious fetal anomaly. Yet, also 
for fetal medicine teams the situation gets more complex as they must weigh up
the risks and benefits to the fetus as well as the mother, while managing a
changing evidence base and logistic challenges in their healthcare system.

Protein corona formation is critical for the design of ideal and safe
nanoparticles (NPs) for nanomedicine, biosensing, organ targeting, and other
applications, but methods to quantitatively predict the formation of the protein 
corona, especially for functional compositions, remain unavailable. The
traditional linear regression model performs poorly for the protein corona, as
measured by R 2 (less than 0.40). Here, the performance with R 2 over 0.75 in the
prediction of the protein corona was achieved by integrating a machine learning
model and meta-analysis. NPs without modification and surface modification were
identified as the two most important factors determining protein corona
formation. According to experimental verification, the functional protein
compositions (e.g., immune proteins, complement proteins, and apolipoproteins) in
complex coronas were precisely predicted with good R 2 (most over 0.80).
Moreover, the method successfully predicted the cellular recognition (e.g.,
cellular uptake by macrophages and cytokine release) mediated by functional
corona proteins. This workflow provides a method to accurately and quantitatively
predict the functional composition of the protein corona that determines cellular
recognition and nanotoxicity to guide the synthesis and applications of a wide
range of NPs by overcoming limitations and uncertainty.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared that the Corona Virus (COVID-19)
has become a global pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the psychological
symptoms of ordinary Chinese citizens during the Level I Emergency Response
throughout China. From January 31 to February 2 2020, an online questionnaire,
Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) was designed, and differences in GSI T-scores among
subgroups were examined by ANOVA. Based on a cut-off point of the GSI T-scores of
63, the overall sample was divided into high and low-risk groups. of the 1,060
participants investigated in China, more than 70% of them have moderate and
higher level of psychological symptoms specifically elevated scores for obsessive
compulsion, interpersonal sensitivity, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism. There
were no significant differences between males and females. Those who were of over
50 years old, had an undergraduate education and below, were divorced or widowed,
and agricultural workers had significantly more symptoms. However, significantly 
more minors and medical staff were in the high-risk group. These results show
that COVID-19 has a significant adverse socio-psychological influence on ordinary
citizens. Therefore, governments should equip psychological health departments
and pay attention to the people who are in high-risk groups, providing
psychological interventions and assistance.

OBJECTIVE: We explored whether medical health workers had more psychosocial
problems than nonmedical health workers during the COVID-19 outbreak.
METHODS: An online survey was run from February 19 to March 6, 2020; a total of
2,182 Chinese subjects participated. Mental health variables were assessed via
the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Symptom Check List-revised (SCL-90-R), and
the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), which included a 2-item anxiety scale
and a 2-item depression scale (PHQ-2).
RESULTS: Compared with nonmedical health workers (n = 1,255), medical health
workers (n = 927) had a higher prevalence of insomnia (38.4 vs. 30.5%, p < 0.01),
anxiety (13.0 vs. 8.5%, p < 0.01), depression (12.2 vs. 9.5%; p< 0.04),
somatization (1.6 vs. 0.4%; p < 0.01), and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (5.3 vs.
2.2%; p < 0.01). They also had higher total scores of ISI, GAD-2, PHQ-2, and
SCL-90-R obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p ≤ 0.01). Among medical health workers, 
having organic disease was an independent factor for insomnia, anxiety,
depression, somatization, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p < 0.05 or 0.01).
Living in rural areas, being female, and being at risk of contact with COVID-19
patients were the most common risk factors for insomnia, anxiety,
obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and depression (p < 0.01 or 0.05). Among
nonmedical health workers, having organic disease was a risk factor for insomnia,
depression, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p < 0.01 or 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, medical health workers had
psychosocial problems and risk factors for developing them. They were in need of 
attention and recovery programs.

The current pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has focused the
attention of medical-care providers away from non-life-threatening diseases,
including infertility. Although infertility does not jeopardize the physical
survival of infertile couples, it does jeopardize their future quality of life.
Human infertility can be caused by a number of factors, some of which are
age-dependent, and their effects may become irreversible if appropriate measures 
are not taken in time to prevent irreversible childlessness. Accordingly, each
case of infertility should be evaluated comprehensively to establish its position
of priority. Assisted reproductive technology (ART) makes it possible to separate
fertilization and pregnancy in time. Whereas pregnant women infected with
coronavirus may have an increased risk of adverse neonatal outcomes, gametes do
not transmit COVID-19. Thus, performing ovarian stimulation and fertilization
without delay, freezing the resulting embryos and delaying embryo transfer until 
the end of the pandemic appears to be the best strategy at present.

This paper presents an analysis of risk mitigation measures taken by countries
around the world facing the current COVID-19 outbreak. In light of the current
pandemic the authors collated and clustered (using harmonised terminology) the
risk mitigation measures taken around the globe in the combat to contain, and
since March 11 2020, to limit the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus known to cause
the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This overview gathers lessons learnt,
providing an update on the current knowledge for authorities, sectors and first
responders on the effectiveness of said measures, and may allow enhanced
prevention, preparedness and response for future outbreaks. Various measures such
as mobility restrictions, physical distancing, hygienic measures, socio-economic 
restrictions, communication and international support mechanisms have been
clustered and are reviewed in terms of the nature of the actions taken and their 
qualitative early-perceived impact. At the time of writing, it is still too
premature to express the quantitative effectiveness of each risk mitigation
cluster, but it seems that the best mitigation results are reported when applying
a combination of voluntary and enforceable measures.

Previous studies have indicated associations between several OLIG2 gene
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and susceptibility to schizophrenia among 
Caucasians. Consistent with these findings, postmortem brain and diffusion tensor
imaging studies have indicated that the schizophrenia-risk-associated allele (A) 
in the OLIG2 SNP rs1059004 predicts lower OLIG2 gene expression in the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of schizophrenia patients and reduced
white matter (WM) integrity of the corona radiata in normal brains among
Caucasians. In an effort to replicate the association between this variant and WM
integrity among healthy Japanese, we found that the number of A alleles was
positively correlated with WM integrity in some fiber tracts, including the right
posterior limb of the internal capsule, and with mean blood flow in a widespread 
area, including the inferior frontal operculum, orbital area, and triangular
gyrus. Because the A allele affected WM integrity in opposite directions in
Japanese and Caucasians, we investigated a possible association between the OLIG2
gene SNPs and the expression level of OLIG2 transcripts in postmortem DLPFCs. We 
evaluated rs1059004 and additional SNPs in the 5' upstream and 3' downstream
regions of rs1059004 to cover the broader region of the OLIG2 gene. The 2 SNPs
(rs1059004 and rs9653711) had opposite effects on OLIG2 gene expression in the
DLPFC in Japanese and Caucasians. These findings suggest ethnicity-dependent
opposite effects of OLIG2 gene SNPs on WM integrity and OLIG2 gene expression in 
the brain, which may partially explain the failures in replicating associations
between genetic variants and psychiatric phenotypes among ethnicities.

Diet is an important factor in both the pathogenesis and in the clinical course
of Crohn's disease (CD). However, data on dietary patterns of CD patients are
rather limited in the literature. This cross-sectional study included 60 patients
with CD, aged 18-60 years. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated food
frequency questionnaire to measure food consumption patterns by principal
component analysis (PCA). Multiple regression analysis was performed to
investigate the association between dietary patterns and clinical and demographic
variables. Three dietary patterns were identified: "Traditional + FODMAP" was
associated with symptoms, gender, previous surgeries, and duration of the
disease. "Fitness style" was positively associated with physical activity and
negatively associated with body mass index and smoking. "Snacks and processed
foods" was positively associated with duration of the disease and negatively
associated with age. According to the weekly food consumption analysis, patients 
with active disease consumed less coffee and tea. We found significant
associations between the three dietary patterns and the variables, but not with
the stage of the disease. Prospective studies are necessary to determine the
effects of food consumption patterns on the clinical course of CD.

Recently revised ice core chronologies for Greenland have newly identified one of
the largest sulfate deposition signals of the last millennium as occurring
between 1108 and 1113 CE. Long considered the product of the 1104 CE Hekla
(Iceland) eruption, this event can now be associated with substantial deposition 
seen in Antarctica under a similarly revised chronology. This newly
recognized bipolar deposition episode has consequently been deemed to reveal a
previously unknown major tropical eruption in 1108 CE. Here we show that a unique
medieval observation of a "dark" total lunar eclipse attests to a dust veil over 
Europe in May 1110 CE, corroborating the revised ice-core chronologies.
Furthermore, careful evaluation of ice core records points to the occurrence of
several closely spaced volcanic eruptions between 1108 and 1110 CE. The sources
of these eruptions remain unknown, but we propose that Mt. Asama, whose largest
Holocene eruption occurred in August 1108 CE and is credibly documented by a
contemporary Japanese observer, is a plausible contributor to the elevated
sulfate in Greenland. Dendroclimatology and historical documentation both attest,
moreover, to severe climatic anomalies following the proposed eruptions, likely
providing the environmental preconditions for subsistence crises experienced in
Western Europe between 1109 and 1111 CE.

The occurrence of nanoplastics in oceans' surface waters is no more a hypothesis 
and it could severely affect marine organisms from different trophic levels.
Nanoscale particles interaction with dissolved natural organic matter (NOM)
significantly influence their behaviour and consequently bioavailability and
toxicity to marine species. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are among
the main components of the NOM pool in seawater yet have been so far little
investigated for their effect in altering the physical-chemical properties of
nanosized objects. Here we employed EPS from marine diatom Phaeodactylum
tricornutum to study the evolution of an eco-corona formation upon incubation
with 60 nm carboxylated polystyrene nanoparticles (PS-COOH NPs), as proxy for
nanoplastics in seawater. EPS significantly reduced PS-COOH NPs aggregation rate 
compared to biomolecule free natural seawater (NSW) and caused the formation of
complexes constituted by both carbohydrate and protein components. Size Exclusion
Chromatography (SEC) revealed four main distinct groups of peaks, spanning from
high (>100 kDa) to low molecular weight (20 kDa) molecules, characterized by a
high chemical heterogeneity. The lowering of the chromatographic signals detected
after EPS incubation with PS-COOH NPs, mainly in the eluates at high molecular
weight, suggests that an important fraction of EPS remained adsorbed on PS-COOH
NPs. In agreement, SDS-PAGE analysis of proteins adsorbed on PS-COOH showed the
occurrence of an eco-corona formed by proteins in the range of molecular weight
30-100 kDa. No toxicity to diatoms was observed upon PS-COOH exposure (72 h,
1-100 mg L-1) even by adding a further source of exogenous EPS during exposure.
Moreover, the addition of EPS reduced ROS production, even when cells were
incubated with PS-COOH NPs at 10 and 50 mg L-1, suggesting an antioxidant
scavenging activity of EPS.

The COVID-19 pandemic is considered as the most crucial global health calamity of
the century and the greatest challenge that the humankind faced since the 2nd
World War. In December 2019, a new infectious respiratory disease emerged in
Wuhan, Hubei province, China and was named by the World Health Organization as
COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). A new class of corona virus, known as
SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has been found to be
responsible for occurrence of this disease. As far as the history of human
civilization is concerned there are instances of severe outbreaks of diseases
caused by a number of viruses. According to the report of the World Health
Organization (WHO as of April 18 2020), the current outbreak of COVID-19, has
affected over 2164111 people and killed more than 146,198 people in more than 200
countries throughout the world. Till now there is no report of any clinically
approved antiviral drugs or vaccines that are effective against COVID-19. It has 
rapidly spread around the world, posing enormous health, economic, environmental 
and social challenges to the entire human population. The coronavirus outbreak is
severely disrupting the global economy. Almost all the nations are struggling to 
slow down the transmission of the disease by testing & treating patients,
quarantining suspected persons through contact tracing, restricting large
gatherings, maintaining complete or partial lock down etc. This paper describes
the impact of COVID-19 on society and global environment, and the possible ways
in which the disease can be controlled has also been discussed therein.

In hostile and remote environments, such as mountains, forests or suburban areas,
traditional communications may not be available, especially after a disaster,
such as a flood, a forest fire or an earthquake. In these situations, the
wireless networks may become congested or completely disrupted and may not be
adequate to support the traffic generated by rescuers. It is also considered as
the key tool in Corona Virus (COVID-19) battle. Moreover, the conventional
approaches with fixed gateways may not work either, and this might lead to
decoding errors due to the large distance between mobile nodes and the gateway.
To avoid the decoding errors and improve the reliability of the messages, we
propose to use intermediate Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to transfer messages 
from ground-based Long Range (LoRa) nodes to the remote base station (BS).
Specifically, this UAV-enabled LoRa architecture is based on the ad hoc WiFi
network, wherein, UAVs act as relays for the traffic generated between LoRa nodes
and BS. To make the architecture more efficient, a distributed topology control
algorithm is also proposed for UAVs. The algorithm is based on virtual spring
forces and movement prediction technique that periodically updates the UAV
topology to adapt to the movement of the ground-based LoRa nodes that move on the
surface. The simulation results show the feasibility of the proposed approach for
packet reception rate and average delay quality of service (QoS) metrics. It is
observed that the mechanisms implemented in a UAV-enabled LoRa network
effectively help to improve the packet reception rate with nominal buffer delays.

Electrostatic Charged Nanofiber Filter for Filtering Airborne Novel Coronavirus
(COVID-19) and Nano-aerosols.

Kong.

The World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak 
as a pandemic on March 12, 2020. Within 3-1/2 months since outbreak in December
2019, over 1.3 million people have been infected across 206 countries with over
70,000 deaths. COVID-19 has a size of 60-140nm with mean size of the
nano-aerosols, 100nm. The virus can be airborne by attaching to human secretion
(fine particles, nasal/saliva droplets) of infected person or suspended fine
particulates in air. While NIOSH has standardized N95 and N98 at 300nm, to-date
there is no filter standards, nor special filter technologies, tailored for
capturing airborne viruses and 100nm nano-aerosols. The latter also are present
in high number concentration in atmospheric pollutants. This study addresses
developing novel charged PVDF nanofiber filter technology to effectively capture 
the deadly airborne coronavirus with our target set at 100nm (nano-aerosol), and 
not 300nm. The virus and its attached particle were simulated by sodium chloride 
aerosols, 50-500nm, generated from sub-micron aerosol generator. PVDF nanofibers 
were produced with fiber diameters 84, 191, 349 and 525nm with excellent
morphology. The fibers were subsequently charged by corona discharge. The amounts
of charged fibers in a filter were increased to achieve high efficiency of 90%
for the virus filter but the electrical interference between neighbouring fibers 
resulted in progressively marginal increase in efficiency and concurrently much
higher pressure drop across the filter. The quality factor which measured the
efficiency-to-pressure-drop kept decreasing. By redistributing the fibers in the 
filter into several modules, each separated by a permeable scrim material, the
electrical interference was reduced, if not fully mitigated. Also, the additional
scrim materials introduced macropores into the filter that further reduced the
airflow resistance. With this approach, the quality factor can maintain
relatively constant with increasing fiber amounts to achieve high filter
efficiency. The optimal amounts of fiber in each module depended on the diameter 
of fibers in the module. Small fiber diameter that has already high performance
required small amount of fibers per module. In contrast, large diameter fiber
required more amounts of fiber per module to compensate for the poorer
performance without incurring higher pressure drop. This approach was applied to 
develop four new nanofiber filters tailored for capturing 100nm airborne COVID-19
to achieve over 90% efficiency with pressure drop below 30Pa (3.1mm water). One
filter developed meeting the 90% efficiency has ultralow pressure drop of only
18Pa (1.9mm water) while another filter meeting the 30Pa limit has high
efficiency reaching 94%. These optimized filters based on rigorous engineering
approach provide the badly needed technology for protecting the general public
from the deadly airborne COVID-19 and other viruses, and nano-aerosols from air
pollution which lead to chronic diseases.

The current understanding of nanoparticle-protein interactions indicates that
they rapidly adsorb proteins upon introduction into a living organism. The formed
protein corona determines thereafter identity and fate of nanoparticles in the
body. The present study evaluates the protein affinity of three core-crosslinked 
polymeric nanoparticles with long circulation times, differing in the hydrophilic
polymer material forming the particle surface, namely
poly(N-2-hydroxypropylmethacrylamide) (pHPMA), polysarcosine (pSar), and
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). This includes the nanotherapeutic CPC634, which is
currently in clinical phase II evaluation. To investigate possible protein corona
formation, the nanoparticles are incubated in human blood plasma and separated by
asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4). Notably, light scattering shows
no detectable differences in particle size or polydispersity upon incubation with
plasma for all nanoparticles, while in gel electrophoresis, minor amounts of
proteins can be detected in the particle fraction. Label-free quantitative
proteomics is additionally applied to analyze and quantify the composition of the
proteins. It proves that some proteins are enriched, but their concentration is
significantly less than one protein per particle. Thus, most of the nanoparticles
are not associated with any proteins. Therefore, this work underlines that
polymeric nanoparticles can be synthesized, for which a protein corona formation 
does not take place.

Nanomaterials (NMs) are promptly coated with biomolecules in biological systems
leading to the formation of the so-called corona. To date, research has
predominantly focused on the protein corona and how it affects NM uptake,
distribution, and bioactivity by conferring a biological identity to NMs enabling
interactions with receptors to mediate cellular responses. Thus, protein corona
studies are now integral to nanosafety assessment. However, a larger class of
molecules, the metabolites, which are orders of magnitude smaller than proteins
(<1000 Da) and regulate metabolic pathways, has been largely overlooked. This
hampers the understanding of the bio-nano interface, development of computational
predictions of corona formation, and investigations into uptake or toxicity at
the cellular level, including identification of molecular initiating events
triggering adverse outcome pathways. Here, a capillary electrophoresis-mass
spectrometry based metabolomics approach reveals that pure polar ionogenic
metabolite standards differentially adsorb to a range of 6 NMs (SiO2 , 3 TiO2
with different surface chemistries, and naïve and carboxylated polystyrene NMs). 
The metabolite corona composition is quantitatively compared using protein-free
and complete plasma samples, revealing that proteins in samples significantly
change the composition of the metabolite corona. This key finding provides the
basis to include the metabolite corona in future nanosafety endeavors.

In this study, corona discharge at atmospheric pressure under an alternating
current (AC) field with a multi-needle plate electrode structure was used as
mutagen to study the effects of corona discharge field on the hydrophilicity of
alfalfa seeds, especially the effects of non-uniform electric field that is
frequently ignored. Alfalfa seed were divided into two groups, one group was
covered with 1 mm-thick polypropylene petri dish cover that can be approximated
as a single factor effect of non-uniform electric field, the other group was
directly irradiated by corona discharge field under different parameters. Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and dual-index sequence analysis were used
to detect and compare the spectra of alfalfa seed coats with different
treatments. Results showed that the peaks of the seed coat at 2856 and 1727 cm-1 
in the treatment group changed, indicating that hydrophobic wax, lipid, and
cellulose may be cracked or degraded. Corona discharge field treatment can change
the chemical structure of alfalfa seed coats, resulting in the changes in their
hydrophilicity. The results of the apparent contact angle and scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) and other experiments showed that the change in 19 kV
non-covered treatment group was greatest, the petri dish cover can effectively
reduce the physicochemical etching of ionic wind, the hydrophilicity of alfalfa
seeds improved after corona discharge field treatment regardless of whether there
is an ionic effect during irradiation, and the ionic wind has a greater influence
on the hydrophilicity of alfalfa seeds than the non-uniform electric field. This 
study revealed the biological effect mechanism of corona discharge field from the
perspective of spectral characteristics and provided experimental data support
for the analysis of alfalfa seed surface modification and chemical structure
after corona discharge field treatment.

Temporary Emergency Guidance to US Stroke Centers During the COVID-19 Pandemic.

[No authors listed]

During this unprecedented time of extraordinary stress on the US healthcare
system, the AHA/ASA Stroke Council-as individuals in our localities and together 
as an entity at the national level-acknowledge the mounting concern regarding
optimal stroke care during the COVID-19 pandemic among vascular neurologists and 
those clinicians who care for patients with stroke. We therefore seek to provide 
guidance for the care of stroke patients in the midst of the crisis. Ordinarily, 
national recommendations go through a rigorous process of development,
refinement, peer review, and thoughtful promulgation. None of that is possible at
this time, yet we believe there is a substantial need for a broad policy
statement that reflects both the commonality of the pandemic across the US and
the individual variability necessary at local sites. We issue this temporary
statement as an interim stopgap opinion, pending a more thorough and considered
process.

Background and Purpose- Widespread reductions in white matter integrity are
associated with cognitive dysfunction in sickle cell anemia. Silent cerebral
infarction (SCI), vasculopathy (VSC), and low hemoglobin concentration (Hb) are
implicated; we aimed to determine independent contributions to microstructural
white matter injury and whether white matter integrity differs across arterial
territories. Methods- Sixty two children with sickle cell anemia aged 6 to 19
years were prospectively studied at Muhimbili National Hospital, Tanzania. SCI±
and VSC± were identified on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance
angiography (MRA) scans by 2 neuroradiologists. Tract-based spatial statistics
tested for voxel-wise differences in diffusion tensor imaging metrics (ie,
fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial
diffusivity) between SCI± and VSC± groups, with correlations between diffusion
tensor imaging metrics and Hb. In tract-based spatial statistics analyses,
potentially mediating factors (ie, age, sex, as well as Hb, SCI, and/or
vasculopathy) were covariates. Differences in mean diffusion tensor imaging
metrics across regions of interest in arterial territories were explored.
Results- Compared with SCI- patients (n=45), SCI+ patients (n=17) exhibited
increased radial diffusivity in multiple regions; negative relationships were
observed between mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and Hb (P<0.005). Compared 
with VSC- patients (n=49), mild (n=6) or moderate (n=7) VSC+ patients exhibited
reduced fractional anisotropy in widespread regions (P<0.05) including the
anterior longitudinal fasciculi, corpus callosum, internal capsule, corona
radiata, and corticospinal tracts. Overall, the posterior cerebral arterial
territory had higher mean mean diffusivity and mean radial diffusivity than the
anterior and middle cerebral arterial territories, although no patient had
vasculopathy in this area. There was an interaction between territory and
vasculopathy. Conclusions- SCI, vasculopathy, and Hb are independent risk
factors, and thus treatment targets, for diffuse white matter injury in patients 
with sickle cell anemia. Exacerbation of hemodynamic stress may play a role.

This is a rejoinder of Dr. Ian Mitroff's perspective titled "Corona Virus: A
Prime Example of A Wicked Mess". While I agree with Dr. Mitroff on the complexity
of the COVID-19 outbreak and the urgency to address it, I disagree with him on
points related to the role of wet market in this specific outbreak and whether
China had acknowledged the existence of the outbreak. I also consider key
highlights of the outbreak are the importance of collaboration across national
and state borders and a balance between privacy and public health under such
situations.

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a novel infectious disease caused by the severe acute
respiratory distress (SARS)-corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Several therapeutic
options are currently emerging but none with universal consensus or proven
efficacy. Solid organ transplant recipients are perceived to be at increased risk
of severe COVID-19 because of their immunosuppressed conditions due to chronic
use of immunosuppressive drugs. It is therefore likely that solid organ
transplant recipients will be treated with these experimental antivirals.
METHODS: This article is not intended to provide a systematic literature review
on investigational treatments tested against COVID-19; rather, the authors aim to
provide recommendations for therapeutic drug monitoring of immunosuppressive
drugs in transplant recipients infected with SARS-CoV-2 based on a review of
existing data in the literature.
RESULTS: Management of drug-drug interactions between investigational
anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs and immunosuppressants is a complex task for the clinician.
Adequate immunosuppression is necessary to prevent graft rejection while, if
critically ill, the patient may benefit from pharmacotherapeutic interventions
directed at limiting SARS-CoV-2 viral replication. Maintaining immunosuppressive 
drug concentrations within the desired therapeutic range requires a highly
individualized approach that is complicated by the pandemic context and lack of
hindsight.
CONCLUSIONS: With the present manuscript, the authors inform the clinician about 
the potential interactions of experimental COVID-19 treatments with
immunosuppressive drugs used in transplantation. Recommendations regarding
therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustments in the context of COVID-19 are
provided.

BACKGROUND: Dalbavancin, albeit indicated for the treatment of skin structure
infections, is used for a much wider range of infections. This drug is
characterized by a long half-life (more than 200 hours), a favorable safety
profile, and an activity against a wide array of gram-positive organisms,
including several strains of Staphylococci and Enterococci.
METHODS: In this study, we presented 3 cases of critically ill patients treated
with dalbavancin. All patients were therapeutically monitored for plasma
dalbavancin concentrations; ultrafiltrate dalbavancin concentrations were
assessed in a patient undergoing continuous renal-replacement therapy.
Dalbavancin concentrations were measured using a validated liquid chromatographic
method coupled with mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: All 3 severely ill patients experiencing necrotizing fasciitis were
successfully treated during the acute phase with dalbavancin. Dalbavancin
clearance in patient 3 (0.334 L/h) was considerably increased compared with
values measured in the other 2 patients (0.054 and 0.075 L/h) and with data
reported in the literature (0.04-0.06 L/h).
CONCLUSIONS: Our case reports presented preliminary evidence that dalbavancin can
be considered a therapeutic option for necrotizing fasciitis in intensive care
unit patients. The role of hypoalbuminemia during dalbavancin exposure merits
further investigation.

Although screening has reduced mortality rates for colorectal cancer (CRC), about
20% of patients still carry metastases at diagnosis. Postsurgery chemotherapy is 
toxic and induces drug resistance. Promising alternative strategies rely on
repurposing drugs such as aspirin (ASA) and metformin (MET). Here, tumor
spheroids were generated in suspension by primary CRCs and metastatic lymph nodes
from 11 patients. These spheroids presented a heterogeneous cell population
including a small core of CD133+/ESA+ cancer stem cells surrounded by a thick
corona of CDX2+/CK20+ CRC cells, thus maintaining the molecular hallmarks of the 
tumor source. Spheroids were exposed to ASA and/or MET at different doses for up 
to 7 days to assess cell growth, migration, and adhesion in three-dimensional
assays. While ASA at 5 mM was always sufficient to mitigate cell migration, the
response to MET was patient specific. Only in MET-sensitive spheroids, the 5 mM
ASA/MET combination showed an effect. Interestingly, CRCs from diabetic patients 
daily pretreated with MET gave a very low spheroid yield due to reduced cancer
cell survival. This study highlights the potential of ASA/MET treatments to
modulate CRC spreading.

Innovative "Bring-Service-Near-Your-Home" Operations under Corona-Virus
(COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2) Outbreak: Can Logistics Become the Messiah?

Choi TM(1).

Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong.

The corona virus (COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2) outbreak has created serious disruptions
to many business operations. Among them, many service operations, which require
customers to travel and visit a place indoor, become almost infeasible to run in 
a crowded city like Hong Kong. Motivated by a recent reported real case on an
innovative service operation in Hong Kong, we build analytical models to explore 
how logistics and technologies together can transform the "static service
operations" to become the "bring-service-near-your-home" mobile service
operations. We also highlight how the government may provide the subsidy to
support the above mentioned mobile service operation (MSO) to make it financially
viable. We specifically show that the government may adopt the fixed-cost-subsidy
(FCS) scheme, operations-cost-subsidy (OCS) scheme or safety-technology-support
(STS) scheme to help. We further uncover that the OCS scheme would bring a larger
consumer surplus than the FCS scheme and is hence more preferable. In the
extended models, we first study the case when service fee cannot be changed
because of corona virus outbreak (CVO). We then explore the feasibility of
adopting MSO in the long run as a financially self-sustainable service operation 
and derive the analytical conditions under which MSO is a win-win business model 
for both the service provider and consumers. Finally, we study the optimal safety
technology investment problem.

The novel coronavirus infection that initially found at the end of 2019 has
attracted great attention. So far, the number of infectious cases has increased
globally to more than 100 thousand and the outbreak has been defined as a
pandemic situation, but there are still no "specific drug" available. Relevant
reports have pointed out the novel coronavirus has 80% homology with SARS. In the
difficulty where new synthesized drug cannot be applied immediately to patients, 
"conventional drug in new use" becomes a feasible solution. The first medication 
experience of the recovered patients in the US has led remdesivir to be the
"specific drug". China has also taken immediate action to put remdesivir into
clinical trials with the purpose of applying it into clinical therapeutics for
Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). We started from the structure,
immunogenicity, and pathogenesis of coronavirus infections of the novel
coronavirus. Further, we analyzed the pharmacological actions and previous trials
of remdesivir to identify the feasibility of conducting experiments on COVID-19.

COVID-19 (corona virus disease 2019) is a kind of acute severe pneumonia caused
by 2019-nCoV (2019-nCoV) infection. Since December 2019, it has been found in
Wuhan, Hubei Province, and then spread to the whole country. Some parts of the
world also showed an outbreak trend [1-3]. Real-time fluorescence quantitative
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (reverse transcriptase-polymerase
chain reaction,RT-PCR) and viral gene sequencing are the gold standard for the
diagnosis of COVID-19. At present, upper respiratory tract nasopharyngeal swabs
are mostly used as nucleic acid detection samples in China, but the positive rate
is low. However, there are few reports on clinical application of 2019-nCoV
nucleic acid detection in other biological samples. METHODS: | The East Section
of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University is a designated COVID-19 hospital in Wuhan
City, Hubei Province, China. This observation study included 132 patients
diagnosed with COVID-19 in the infectious disease areas of the East Section of
Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from 2020.1.31 to 2020.2.29. COVID-19
diagnostic criteria: according to China's 《pneumonia diagnosis and treatment
Program of novel coronavirus infection (trial version 7) 》, in accordance with
the relevant epidemiological and clinical manifestations, nasopharyngeal swabs
real-time fluorescence RT-PCR detection of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid positive,
COVID-19 cases were divided into mild, ordinary, severe and severe [4]. The
nasopharyngeal swabs of 132 cases of COVID-19 were positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic
acid on admission, including 72 males and 60 females, with an average age of
66.7 ± 9.1 years, including 80 cases of common type, 44 cases of severe type and 
8 cases of critical type. During the period of admission, under the condition of 
tertiary protection, nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, blood, feces and anal swabs of
COVID-19 cases were collected many times in the isolation ward for 2019-nCoV
nucleic acid detection. All biological samples are sealed and transferred to the 
laboratory in strict accordance with the standard process. The RT-PCR test kits
(BioGerm) were recommended by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and
Prevention. The same technician and brand of test kit was used for all RT-PCR
testing reported; both internal controls and negative controls were routinely
performed with each batch of tests. RESULTS: | 132 the results of 2019-nCoV
nucleic acid test of various biological samples during the treatment of confirmed
COVID-19 cases are as follows: the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test
of nasopharyngeal swab is 38.13% (180/472 times), the positive rate of 2019-nCoV 
nucleic acid test of sputum is 48.68% (148/304 times), the positive rate of blood
2019-nCoV nucleic acid test is 3.03% (4/132 times), and the positive rate of
2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of feces is 9.83% (24/244 times). The positive rate
of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection in anal swabs is 10.00% (12/120 times).
DISCUSSION|: In this study, it was found that the positive rate of 2019-nCoV
nucleic acid in sputum of 132 patients with COVID-19 was higher than that of
nasopharyngeal swabs, and viral nucleic acids were also detected in blood and
digestive tract (fecal/anal swabs). Simple detection of nasopharyngeal swab
2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection positive rate is not high, multi-sample
2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection can improve the accuracy, reduce the false
negative rate, better guide clinical treatment and evaluate the therapeutic
effect.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was firstly reported at the end of 2019. The
disease rapidly spread all around the world in a few months and was declared a
worldwide pandemic by WHO in March 2020. By April 9, there were 1,436,198
confirmed COVID-19 cases in the world, nearly with 6% mortality rate. This novel 
infectious disease causes respiratory tract illness that may generally occur as
mild upper respiratory tract disease or pneumonia. In older patients and/or
patients with underlying conditions, it may result in acute respiratory distress 
syndrome, multi organ failure and even death. According to the current
literature, children account approximately for 1%–5% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases.
Generally, COVID-19 seems to be a less severe disease for children than adults.
Approximately 90% of pediatric patients are diagnosed as asymptomatic, mild, or
moderate disease. However, up to 6.7% of cases may be severe. Severe illness is
generally seen in patients smaller than 1 year of age and patients who have
underlying disesases. The epidemiological and clinical patterns of COVID-19 and
treatment approaches in pediatric patients still remain unclear although many
pediatric reports are published. This review aims to summarize the current
epidemics, clinical presentations, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19 in
pediatric patients.

Along the centuries, novel strain of virus such as influenza produces pandemics
which increase illness, death and disruption in the countries. Spanish flu in
1918, Asian flu in 1957, Hong Kong flu in 1968 and swine flu in 2009 were known
pandemic which had various characteristics in terms of morbidity and mortality. A
current pandemic is caused by novel corona virus originated from China. COVID-19 
pandemic is very similar to Spanish, Hong Kong, Asian and swine influenza
pandemics in terms of spreading to world by the mobilized people. Burden of
pandemic is considered in terms of disease transmissibility and the growth rate
of epidemic and duration of pandemic can be calculated by transmissibility
characteristic. The case definition, finding out cases and first case cluster,
proper treatment, sufficient stockpiles of medicine and population cooperation
with the containment strategy should be considered for reduction of burden of
pandemic.

Objective: During pectopexy surgery, the prolapsed uterus or the vaginal apex is 
fixed to the pectineal ligament. The anatomic structures found in the lateral
part of the prevesical and paravaginal space above the obturator fossa, raise the
importance of the surgical steps required to prevent complications. This study
was conducted to evaluate the proximity of vascular structures to the pectineal
ligament.
Materials and Methods: The distances between the surgical suturing area during
pectopexy surgery and the external iliac vein, pubic anastomotic vessel (corona
mortis) and obturator canal were measured bilaterally in seven fresh female
cadavers.
Results: The total length of the pectineal ligament was 5.9±0.76 cm on the left
and 6.5±1.14 cm on the right side; the midpoint of the pectineal ligament was
2.8±0.52 cm on the left and 3.6±0.47 cm on the right side. From the midpoint of
the left pectineal ligament, the mean distance to the left external iliac vein
was 1.04±0.23 cm, to the left corona mortis it was 2.15±0.48 cm, and to the left 
obturator canal it was 3.12±0.95 cm. From the midpoint of the right pectineal
ligament, the mean distance to the right external iliac vein was 1.25±0.43 cm, to
the right corona mortis it was 2.37±0.63 cm, and to the right obturator canal it 
was 3.57±0.93 cm.
Conclusion: The anatomic findings of the study confirmed that the pectineal
ligament was in close association with main vessels. The external iliac vein was 
measured as the closest anatomic structure to the pectineal ligament. Surgeons
must be careful to minimize life-threatening complications because of the
proximity of the pectineal ligament to main vessels.

The pandemic of COVID-19 is seriously challenging the medical organization in
many parts of the world. This novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2 has a specific
tropism for the low respiratory airways, but causes severe pneumonia in a low
percentage of patients. However, the rapid spread of the infection during this
pandemic is causing the need to hospitalize a high number of patients. Pneumonia 
in COVID-19 has peculiar features and can be studied by lung ultrasound in the
early approach to suspected patients. The sonographic signs are non-specific when
considered alone, but observation of some aspects of vertical artifacts can
enhance the diagnostic power of the ultrasound examination. Also, the combination
of sonographic signs in patterns and their correlation with blood exams in
different phenotypes of the disease may allow for a reliable characterization and
be of help in triaging and admitting patients.

The coronavirus pandemic is a major challenge for healthcare systems worldwide.
For urology, the expansion of the health-care structures for the treatment of
patients suffering from COVID-19 should be supported as best as possible. At the 
same time, one should aim to ensure adequate care for urological emergencies and 
urgent urological treatments as far as possible, even during the pandemic. For
this, patients must be prioritized individually, alternative therapy concepts
must be considered and regional and supraregional cooperation must be used.
Outpatient departments are of great importance in the care, examination and
coordination of urological emergencies and urgent treatment. Urological clinics
must prepare themselves to perform urgent operations and interventions on
SARS-CoV‑2-positive patients. Here, the creation of a separate, appropriately
equipped emergency operating room to perform operations and interventions on
SARS-CoV‑2 patients should be considered. Furthermore strictly defined hygiene
measures to protect employees in various clinical scenarios should be set up.

Corona Mortis Artery Pseudoaneurysm Causing Delayed Intermittent Hemoperitoneum
after Robotic Radical Prostatectomy.

Han J, Shah M, Djaladat H, Aron M.

Pseudoaneurysms are rare in urology and typically have a delayed presention with 
intermittent episodes of bleeding. We report a patient who presented with delayed
and recurent hemoperitoneum following robotic assisted laparoscopic salvage
radical prostatectomy and was found to have a pseudoaneurysm in the corona mortis
artery.

Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 ligand, resiquimod, has been studied as an adjuvant
and antiviral agent against several pathogens in chicken. Yet, the effectiveness 
of resiquimod against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infection has not been
evaluated. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of resiquimod
delivered pre-hatch (in ovo) against IBV infection post-hatch identifying key
mechanisms involved in resiquimod driven immune activation. First, we found an
upregulation of interleukin (IL)-1β and interferon (IFN)-γ mRNA levels and
considerable expansions of macrophage and cluster of differentiation (CD) 8α+ T
cell populations in lungs of chicken as early as day one post-hatch, following
pre-hatch delivery of resiquimod. Second, we observed that resiquimod was able to
act as an adjuvant when resiquimod was delivered pre-hatch along with an
inactivated IBV vaccine. Finally, when the resiquimod pretreated one-day-old
chickens were infected with IBV, reduction in viral shedding via oral and fecal
routes was observed at 3 days post- infection. Overall, this study shows that the
pre-hatch delivered resiquimod increases cell-mediated immune responses in lungs 
with an advantage of reduction in IBV shedding.

The present outbreak associated with corona virus [CoVs] in China which is
believed to be one of the massive eruptions towards mankind in 2019-2020. In the 
present scenario CoVs has been transmitted to the European and American regions
through the travellers from wide spread countries like China and Japan. The viral
disease is spreading through the contact in any form by the infected persons or
patients and creating huge risk of mortality. CoVs are a single positive-sense
RNA virus; mutation rates are higher than DNA viruses and indicate a more
effective survival adaption mechanism. Human CoVs can cause common cold and
influenza-like illness and a variety of severe acute respiratory disease such as 
pneumonia. Early in infection, CoVs infects epithelial cells, macrophages,
T-cells, dendritic cells and also can affect the development and implantation of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. It mainly produces the melanoma
differentiation associated with protein-5, retinoic acid inducible gene-1 and
endosomal toll-like receptor 3. How CoVs affects the function of the immune
system is still unclear due to lack of this knowledge. No Food and Drug
Administration approved treatment is available till date. In this review, we are 
tried to explore the epidemiology, pathogenesis and current treatment of CoVs
infection. The promising therapeutics molecules against CoVs and future
prospective have been also discussed which will be helpful for researchers to
find out the new molecules for the treatment of CoVs disease.

Epidemically increased evidence reveals that the link between the 2019-nCoV and
other similar strain of coronaviruses circulating in bats and specifically the
Rhinopodous bat sub-species. These sub-species are ample and widely present in
Southern China, Middle East Africa and Europe. Recent studies show that more than
500 CoV have been identified in bats in China. The Center for Diseases Control
and Prevention and the World Health Organization maintains a website that is
updated frequently with new cases of MERS-CoV infection. As per WHO Situation
report 16th, 24,554 number of cases confirmed globally out of which 99.22% cases 
from china. A new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is causing respiratory syndrome mostly 
in Hubei Province, China. Corona Virus spread over 24 countries including Japan, 
India, Korea, and other countries 2019-CoV infection vary from mild, moderate or 
severe illness; the later includes severe pneumonia, ARDS, sepsis and septic
shock. There are two diagnostic tests for coronavirus infection i.e. molecular
test and serology test. In this review article there are the various recent cases
of the patients that are suffering from the corona virus, the outcome of these
studies is that corona virus infection is an epidemic disease which affects
Central Nervous System (CNS).

The international division of labour implies both advantages and disadvantages to
an economy. As long as the marginal costs and marginal benefi ts associated with 
the international division of labour stick to standard economic theory, there is 
an optimal degree of this division for every economy. The corona pandemic is
likely to change the fundamentals for relevant decisions-both from the
perspective of companies and of the society as a whole-in such a way that the
extent of the division of labour and international trade will decrease
correspondingly.

The fight against the coronavirus pandemic has led to an insulation of social and
economic life and will have considerable economic consequences. Important areas
of the industry and service sectors were partially or completely shutdown. A
resumption of activity should happen as soon as possible, once the medical
pre-conditions have been established and are met. This requires a clear exit
strategy and following several steps to return to previous welfare and growth
data levels. After securing survival during this crisis via various liquidity
lines and bridging loans, the economy's restart requires the relaunch of public
infrastructure, especially of schools and kindergartens. To facilitate a
coordinated and synchronised restart of complex industrial value chains, we need 
clear signals on a planned schedule. A tax policy driven departure signal and a
demand side focused growth programme could make an important contribution to a
new economic dynamic after the crisis.

The corona crisis started in China and had great consequences for public health
and the economy. In the meantime, high and rapidly growing numbers of cases of
infections with SARS-CoV-2 have also been recorded in Japan, Korea, Italy,
Germany, Great Britain, France, Spain and above all in the USA. Forecasts of
economic growth have been massively revised downwards and governments around the 
world are struggling to find the right economic policy response. This article
describes basic short-term options for the German government to react to the
corona shock and briefl y assesses the package of measures "Schutzschirm für
Beschäftigte und Unternehmen" presented on 13 March 2020 by the German Finance
Minister Olaf Scholz and the German Economics Minister Peter Altmaier.

According to the leading German economic research institutes, the German economy 
is experiencing a drastic slump as a result of the corona pandemic. In order to
slow down the wave of infection, the state has severely restricted economic
activity in Germany. As a result, GDP is expected to shrink by 4.2% this year.
The recession is leaving clear traces on the labour market and the national
budget. At its peak, the unemployment rate will soar to 5.9% and the number of
short-time workers to 2.4 million. This year, the fiscal policy stabilisation
measures will lead to a record deficit in the general government budget of 159
billion euro. After the shutdown, the economy will gradually recover.
Accordingly, the increase in GDP next year will be strong at 5.8%. This forecast 
is associated with considerable downside risks, e.g. because the pandemic can be 
slowed faster or because the recovery of economic activity will be less
successful than expected or there may be a new wave of infection.

BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease
associated with increased risk of stroke. Antiphospholipid syndrome is another
autoimmune disease that frequently overlaps with SLE. We report the case of a
patient presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage after ischemic stroke associated 
with SLE and antiphospholipid syndrome.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 22-year-old man presented with cerebral infarction of the
right corona radiata. He had no contributory past or family histories. On imaging
at this time, a 4-mm fusiform aneurysm of the right anterior cerebral artery was 
incidentally detected. Several examinations were performed, but no abnormalities 
or abnormal lesions were seen on echography or whole-body computed tomography.
Blood tests yielded positive results for antinuclear antibody, lupus
anticoagulant, and anti-beta-2 glycoprotein І antibody. He presented 70 days
later with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography showed the same fusiform
aneurysm without any change in shape and no new aneurysms. The balloon occlusion 
test was performed without any neurologic symptoms, so the right anterior
cerebral artery was trapped using coils. After 6 months, he presented with new
optic hyperesthesia and facial butterfly-shaped erythema and fulfilled the
criteria for SLE. At 2 years after initial presentation, he showed no recurrence 
of either aneurysm or ischemic stroke.
CONCLUSIONS: The patient's first ischemic stroke was induced by antiphospholipid 
syndrome and underlying SLE. Fusiform aneurysm may have resulted from focal
vasculitis, with activation of SLE leading to aneurysm rupture.

Hospital, Wuhan 430060, China.

Objective: To introduce Treatment experience of burn patients combined with
inhalation injury during epidemic period of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Methods: Six burn patients combined with inhalation injury were hospitalized in
Department of Burns of Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University& Wuhan Third Hospital
from February 1 to March 1 in 2020duringhigh-incidence period of COVID-19,
including 4 males and 2 females, aged 21-63 years, hospitalized for 2-4 hours,
with total burn areas of 1%-20% TBSA and full-thickness burn areas of 1%-12%
TBSA. Among them, 1 case was severe inhalation injury, 2 cases were mild
inhalation injury, and 3 cases were moderate inhalation injury. The body
temperatures of the patients were normal at admission without fever or cough in
the past 2 weeks. At admission, chest CT of one patient showed double lower lobes
and left upper lobes had multiple slices and slightly high-density shadow of
nodules. Chest CT of two patients showed bilateral lung texture was thickening,
and chest CT of other patients was normal. After admission, 6 patients were given
routine treatment, the medical staffs paid attention to the protection and
screened COVID-19 according to the diagnosis and treatment plan of COVID-19. On
post injury day (PID) 1, 3, 6, and 9, vein blood of patients were collected for
determination of white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil, lymphocyte absolute
value. and level of procalcitonin (PCT). Nucleic acid of novel coronavirus was
detected by real-time fluorescence reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction on PID 3 and 6. The temperatures of patients were recorded after
admission. The results of chest CT within one week after injury and the prognosis
of the patients were recorded. Measurement data distributed normally were
expressed as x ± s, and measurement data distributed abnormally were expressed as
M (P(25), P(75)). Results: (1) On PID1, 3, 6, and 9, WBC counts of patients were 
respectively (19.8±3.8)×10(9)/L, (17.2±3.4)×10(9)/L,(13.3±3.1)×10(9)/L, and
(11.1±1.6)×10(9)/L, neutrophils of patients were
respectively0.919±0.019,0.899±0.011, 0.855±0.034, and0.811±0.035, absolute values
of lymphocytes of patients were
respectively(0.65±0.18)×10(9)/L,(0.65±0.24)×10(9)/L,(0.91±0.34)×10(9)/L, and
(1.23±0.42)×10(9)/L,and PCT values of patients were respectively0.49 (0.36,
1.64), 0.39 (0.26, 0.73), 0.28 (0.18, 0.33), and 0.12 (0.11, 0.20) ng/mL.The
values of WBC and neutrophils of patients were higher than the normal value,
showing a downward trend. The absolute values of lymphocyte of patients returned 
to the normal value gradually. The PCT values of patients were higher than the
normal value. (2) Nucleic acid test results of novel coronavirus of 6 patients
were negative on PID 3 and 6. The temperatures of patients were from 36.5 to 38.6
℃. The typical imaging features of COVID-19 were not found in 6 patients within 1
week after injury by chest CT. After treatment for 14-32 days, 6 patients were
cured and discharged. Conclusions: During the novel coronavirus, burn patients
combined with inhalation injury should be treated under condition of good
protection for COVID-19 among doctors and nurses. Meanwhile, virus should be
actively screened to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection among doctors and
patients.

Since December 2019, a series of highly infectious cases of unexplained pneumonia
have been discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, which have been confirmed as '2019
corona virus disease' caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 virus can invade many human systems including the lungs.
Patients with central nervous system involvement may show a series of
neurological symptoms, which is easy to be misdiagnosed and neglected, thereby
increasing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Hereditary ataxia is a large
group of neurodegenerative diseases with great clinical and genetic heterogeneity
and high mortality and disability. In view of the seriousness of the COVID-19
epidemic, a series of prevention and control measures adopted by the government
have restricted the follow-up, diagnosis and treatment of patients by the
hospitals, which has a great impact on their mental and physical health. In order
to standardize the management of patients during the prevention and control of
COVID-19 epidemic, the Specialized Committee of Neurogenetics of the
Neurophysician Branch of Chinese Medical Doctor Association has formulated this
consensus, with an aim to help patients to overcome the difficulties and pass the
epidemic prevention period safely.
